					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The world is changing at an increasingly rapid rate. </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Customers demand quality products, and services on a global basis.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This challenge cannot be dealt with in isolation, therefore </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">quality design, and CE must be networked into every process.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There are many positive and some negative issues about this. Following the world-wide recession waste is being cut down in factories, in the education system, in research and virtually everywhere in our everyday life. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Furthermore, globalization has a major effect on the way international product design, manufacturing and distribution come into play. </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New, dynamic labor forces in Europe, China, Asia, and India open up new business and investment opportunities,</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> and despite the fact, that instead of negotiating and reasoning better, humans still kill each other to resolve disputes, intelligent, hard working people are moving ahead with plenty of positive energy to establish a better, and sustainable life on planet Earth.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It is now obvious to every logical thinker that adapting quickly to changes in market demand, in product and manufacturing technology and in the social, education and research environment are prerequisites to wealth creation (meaning both intellectual as well as materialistic wealth) and consequently to success in future markets. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We must think and work in new ways. </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As many rightfully say </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'we cannot work harder, we need to be smarter...'. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">With the advance of computers we have experienced the exciting opportunities of CAD (Computer Assisted, and then later, Computer Aided Design and soon I_CAD, Intelligent CAD), CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing), Desktop Publishing, etc. and now we are entering into a new era of highly integrated Desktop Design &amp; Manufacturing or in other words Desktop CIM &amp; Concurrent Engineering. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The fundamental reason for this is that talented engineers find it extremely pleasing to work in a team of engineers and customers, to react to market forces and rapidly create new products and new manufacturing solutions to fabricate these <a href="MediaResources/BMW_SportRear_0177.jpg">new products</a>. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">They are harnessing the growing computing power and the ability to share data via computer networks. The important issue is that this technology is available on the top of their desks, networked via the Internet, literally anywhere in the world!</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As we have discussed earlier, within the TQM framework, concurrent engineering (CE) represents a structured (or in IT terms object-oriented), logical framework which supports a systematic approach to the integrated, concurrent design of products, and their related processes, including manufacture and support.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This method is intended to ensure that developers consider all elements of the product life cycle from concept through re-engineering, and final disposal, including quality, cost schedule and user requirements. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In contrast to the old, conventional, or sequential product design method, Concurrent Engineering focuses on customer satisfaction, on teamwork as well as on Design for Manufacturing, Design for Assembly, Quality and Total Lifecycle issues.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It is essential to understand that none of the Concurrent Engineering or CIM (Computer Integrated Manufacturing) methods work in practice unless they are applied to all levels of the enterprise, that they are introduced gradually and that they are managed by people who understand and support them.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As Dr. Philip Ashton's Concurrent Engineering PhD research work (at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited, supervised by the author of this book) puts it,</font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> 'In the real world there are multiple objects, or perspectives that compete. </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Through object oriented design and manufacturing we can model the interaction between these objects. To do this, we have to define some very elementary principles or characteristics of objects within object modelling'.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">According to Grady Booch's definition, an object is something you can do things to. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">An object has </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">state</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">behavior</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> and </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">identity</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The structure and behavior of similar objects are defined in their common class. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The terms instance and object are interchangeable. An object model is a collection of principles that form the foundation of an object oriented design. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In other words, it is a system modelling, software engineering term emphasizing the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, hierarchy, typing, concurrency and persistence. (Please feel free to look up these terms in the Glossary, in case you aren't familiar with them).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">These principles, and object orientation in general are widely used throughout TQM modeling, as well as in our Case Library series of our eBooks, because of their extreme importance in terms of the productivity and quality gains one can achieve by implementing reusable, tested objects (modules) in product design and in manufacturing, not to forget about IT.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="maroon"><b>Design for Quality<a name="Anchor-11481" id="Anchor-11481"></a></b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Design for Quality (DFQ), Assembly (DFA) and Design for Manufacturing (DFM), in the broadest sense, means designing quality and &quot;manufacturability&quot; into the product and the required processes simultaneously. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The method of design for quality and manufacture is based on the recognition that:</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Note that this &quot;Early Design/Manufacturing Involvement&quot; reduces waste, or put another way, increases the Total Quality of the organisation.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>3.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> The product design must be modular, </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">and should be carefully &quot;tuned&quot; to flexible assembly and manufacturing technologies operated in a lean CIM environment in order to fully realize the achievable quality, productivity, assembly and maintenance improvements.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>4.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> The product and the manufacturing system should be designed with Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> in mind, amongst others, meaning, that the </font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Entire system should be flexible and lean enough to simultaneously produce and partially maintain resources and subsystems</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, without causing major interruptions to production, and,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">System should have </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">significant sensory feedback processing capabilities</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, so that quality changes could be analyzed real-time, predicted, and therefore avoided BEFORE major disasters, and losses occur.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In terms of product design all of the above listed considerations increase customer satisfaction, and in terms of manufacturing and service, reduce the number of accidents, defects, breakdowns, inventories and production losses.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To summarize, DFQ, DFA, DFM mean a level of CAD/CAM integration within a Concurrent Engineering environment, in which product design and manufacturing process are concurrent or parallel versus sequential, non-integrated activities. (Example: <a href="MediaResources/RobotLoaderSmartSensS.mov">sensory feedback controlled robotic manipulator</a>.)</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Ford Motor Company stresses the following basic Total Quality Excellence (TQE) principles that give the foundation to our discussion on design for quality and on various techniques for improving product quality by preventing defects:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Quality is defined by the customer.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> The customer wants products and services that throughout their lifetime meet his or her needs and expectations at a cost that represents value. (Note, that the customer is now a global person, who might be living in the USA, in China, in Europe, in Japan, in India, or Africa, or elsewhere, sitting in front of his / her Internet computer reviewing product / process / service offers over the web, from multiple, different, competing and globally operating companies).</font>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Sustained quality excellence requires continuous product and process improvement.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> This means that regardless of how good the present performance may be, it can become better.</font>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It is a well known and accepted fact that </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Total Quality innovation</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> can lead to commercial success, can create wealth in its broadest sense, can increase the market share and can create high growth and sustainable profits. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Firms must introduce new products that are required by customers and change their processes and organizational structures accordingly. But what are the sources for new, better, higher quality product designs / processes, and services, and how could we become more innovative in terms of introducing total quality? </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Let us attempt to summarize some fundamental concepts and outline some of the methods, that have a proven track record in the real-world.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>New requirements created by the market</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> (i.e. the customers of an old or existing product, or the potential customers of a new product). </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Typical examples include external pressures such as functional requirements and/or improvements, safety, fashion, competition, seasonal factors, economy, etc. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Since this method is typically the most successful source for new product innovation, there are many methods that focus on this, including Quality Function Deployment (QFD), or Component oriented Requirements Analysis (CORA), as we prefer to name this method, market research surveys, process modeling (like CIMpgr) applied to functional, and object decomposition of components, and subassemblies, and others, like processes and services.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>New technology and the exciting new opportunities that it can create</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Think for a moment of the microchip, the mobile (cell) phone, interactive multimedia, or the emerging intelligent sensor technology, full high definition television, 4K and soon 8K video and television, or new materials, such as teflon, or a four axis CNC turning centre and the complex parts one can design for such equipment.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">All of these can create new successful products if the designers and manufacturing engineers keep the customers' real requirements in mind and do not get obsessed with technology for the sake of technology itself. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Observe carefully and grasp the opportunity</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This group includes situation-related development and innovation opportunities when something goes wrong (e.g. the bulb needs to be changed in the car), or a tool wore out, a part breaks because a product is poorly designed, or when electronic connectors are incompatible, and many others. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Grasp the opportunity when, as a result of a systematic study, analysis and observation, new ideas emerge. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Methods, such as QFD, or CORA, Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), or PFRA (Process Failure Risk Analysis), Poka-Yoke, quality circle brainstorming activities, functional and process analysis using CIMpgr modeling, simulation, statistical analysis of selected processes, and others, are good opportunities for this type of innovation.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Concurrent Engineering / Collaborative, Multi-Lifecycle Engineering</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Collaborative, multi-lifecycle Concurrent Engineering within the wealth of a lean CIM, and adaptive supply chain communications infrastructure represents a new opportunity to innovate, since it integrates design, manufacturing, quality control, shop floor automation, marketing and other processes, based on Internet and intranet networking technologies. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In this respect creating a company culture providing the right data via smart, networked sensors, and the climate for innovation is of extreme importance.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Major design orders from a large organization, a major sponsor, or from government</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">These innovation opportunities include Ministry of Defence, or DOD (Department of Defense in the USA) type of work, research and product development for tasks to be performed in space (e.g. space suit, various domestic appliances modified for space use), major security, national safety, and other major building contracts, and others.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Step-by-step innovation, and continuous improvement</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This group of methods has been very successful in particular in the Pacific Rim countries, notably in Japan, gradually spreading back to Europe and the USA. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Whilst the Stevensons, the Henry Fords, and the Steve Jobs have created their first successful products in the garage out of almost nothing, many companies found great success in gradually improving existing products.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Examples include agricultural machines, the television, the automobile, the video and 35mm camera, digital photo and video cameras (starting with Apple's original 640 x 480 pixel digital still camera), moving into advanced 5, 8 and even 16 Megapixel devices, the VCR, the electric organ, the PC, the telephone, the FAX machine, <a href="MediaResources/BMW11_BodyWeld6Test.mov">BMW cars</a>, and many others. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It should be noted, that the CIMpgr object/ component-oriented process modeling methodology, the functional decomposition of objects and their value and gap analysis can be successfully applied to step-by-step innovation and continuous product/process improvement activities. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>The great idea: the 'step-function change opportunity'; The Progressive Enterprise</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This is a rare commodity. There is no research evidence on how a great idea is created in somebody's brain, however there are clear signs that a relaxing holiday, or some positive or negative excitement, or human emotions, such as love, hate, or even a falling apple can contribute to getting that long awaited great idea, that often looks so incredibly simple, after the event.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The key here, is that the enterprise, that can react real-time to new ideas becomes the progressive enterprise, that can take advantage of the new idea, and take it from concept to market in record time.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Systematic search for improvements</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Systematic search for improvements in functionality, quality, for reduced part count and lower cost of an existing or a new product concept. The heart of the methodology is a structured, object - oriented functional analysis using the CIMpgr process modeling method, in collaboration with technology innovation (Esprit <a href="MediaResources/EspritCAM1RougProcPlan.mov">CAM example-1</a>, <a href="MediaResources/EspritCAM2SolidTurnDemo.mov">example-2</a>.) </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Following this method and structured framework, based on the BOM (Bill of Material) file each component and sub-assembly of the product design is analyzed and valued in terms of function, quality, design for assembly, material selection, cost and other aspects such as ergonomy and aesthetics. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Having done the analysis, the losers become targets for innovation, guided by the already established object-oriented framework. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Recession, or a major shock, or lack of resources forcing change</b></font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Recession forcing change.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Major shock. </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Lack of resources during a recession can create positive restructuring processes that turn the company and its existing products upside down and inside out.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Change of ownership, privatisation.</font>
					  <li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Merger, acquisition, and others, causing turbulance, and cultural change, that often produces innovative thoughts, products and/or services.</font>                        
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To summarize, when thinking about the various innovative ideas, products and services as part of the creative, as well as the feedback control / validation process it is worth considering the following questions: </font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Who is my customer? </font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Is there a market (or other) demand for my idea / proposed product / service?</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Is it easy to use? </font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Is it uniquely patentable? Who will own the IP (Intellectual Property)? </font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Who will buy my product or service? </font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Why will they buy mine rather then somebody else's product, or idea? </font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Where can they buy it? </font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What do I need to charge for my innovative product / process / service? </font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Who is my competitor? Am I positioning my product correctly? </font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What regulations (safety, government, environmental, pollution, etc.) will my product and/or service be subject to?</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What cultural, political, religious and other issues will my product and/or service be challenged by?</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Any other considerations, that might come into play (such as hygiene, emotional issues, nutritional aspects, and others)?</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>The research method and toolset, supporting product / process, and service - oriented innovation by CE</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In order to construct a comprehensive research method enabling creative teams to actively focus on innovation opportunities, a reusable, object / component-oriented structured framework a toolset is needed to integrate the specific ideas, and processes of interest through object modelling. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To that end, the research methods and the toolset should give access and use to the following types of modelling as follows:</font></p>
