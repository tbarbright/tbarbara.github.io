					<p><font size="3" color="maroon" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Stereolithography<a name="Anchor-11481" id="Anchor-11481"></a></b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Stereolithography is a 2D or 3D printing process which produces copies of solid or surface models in <a href="MoreCEMedia/Small_SLA_partObj.mov">plastic</a>. The process uses a computer controlled moving laser beam to print or draw cross-sections of the model onto the surface of a photo curable liquid plastic. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The solidification procedure is performed by a Helium Cadmium (HeCd) or Argon laser, using a layer-by-layer illumination process. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The general principle of stereolithography (point to point layer solidification) can be outlined as follows:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>1.</b> 3D model creation at the CAD workstation</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> using solid or surface modelling. Data format has to be specified and downloaded to the stereolithography (SLA) computer.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>2.</b> The SLA computer generates the cross section layers.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> The surface quality, the accuracy and the time it will take to build the physical model will depend on this &quot;slicing&quot; process. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">A support structure is added to hold the gradually built component in the appropriate orientation and position. (Note, that this can be a tricky process.)</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>3.</b> The SLA computer controlled laser beam hardens the polymeric fluid, layer by layer</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> until the component is ready. The hardening of the polymeric fluid is based on the fact that if the material is exposed to a laser or ultra violet (UV) beam, the fluid is immediately hardened by low energy absorption.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>4.</b> The finished component has to be cleaned and the resin removed.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> To be able to do this the part has to be removed carefully from the machine's platform and then cleaned usually with a chemical, called TPM, or by means of ultrasonic technology. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">After this, the supports have to be removed and then the part has to be post-cured using UV light in a Post Curing Apparatus (PCA). If necessary the part can be further polished by hand to achieve the required surface quality.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>The Solid Object UV Laser Plotting (SOUP) Method</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Solid Object UV Laser Plotting (SOUP) shares the basic principle of stereolithography, with the difference that it uses an x/y scanner, rather than a mirror system to control the movements of the laser beam. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Following this principle, the laser beam is always perpendicular to the surface of the resin. The laser power is controlled by a shutter filter.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Solid Ground Curing Process</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The principle of the solid ground curing process is that it hardens photopolymetric materials by illuminating the surface not in a point-to-point mode, but by employing a specially prepared mask and then lightening and hardening the entire surface. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The masks are put on glass plates and are generated from the sliced CAD model and specially prepared using a xerox-method. Despite the machine's complexity, the biggest advantage of the method is its accuracy due of the well controlled process parameters.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>3D Printing</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Three dimensional printing is a layered printing process based on the 2D slices of a 3D CAD solid or surface model, using powder. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Each 2D slice is created by adding a layer of powder to the top of a piston and cylinder, containing the powder bed and the physical object being created.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Each new powder layer is selectively joined by the ink-jet printing method, but only where the physical object is to be formed. The power bed, the physical object to be created and the piston are lowered and slice by slice a new layer of powder is spread and then selectively joined using the ink-jet technology. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This process is carried out until all layers are spread and joined. After heat treatment the unbound powder is removed, leaving the physical object behind.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>The SOLIDER- technique by Schneider and Cubital</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Following the Solider-techniqe, models are constructed layer by layer, to an accuracy +/-0.1% of the linear dimensions, with a minimum wall thickness of 0.4 mm, embedded in a wax cube or matrix which serves as support for overhanging parts and eliminates the need to create and remove special support structures, as in the case of many other rapid prototyping systems. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Using the 2D sliced, binary images, the machine cuts the CAD object into 0.15 mm thick layers. At the end of the process the wax is removed in a special washing machine, which also rinses and cleans the models in a solution of hot water and citric acid.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The creation of the model starts with the 3D CAD solid or surface model as usual. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This data is typically sent via a fast network to a Solider machine. As soon as the CAD data is in the Solider control computer a negative image of each layer is reproduced on a glass slide following an ionographic process. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This mask serves as a lithographic image for the subsequent exposure. In the meantime a moving surface is coated with a thin layer of liquid resin which hardens when in contact with ultraviolet light. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">After this, a brief exposure using UV light solidifies the layer of resin, leaving the unexposed areas liquid.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The liquid is then drained off and the work surface is exposed to a second UV flood lamp, which then hardens the resin further. This process eliminates the need for any post-curing and possible shrinkage of the fabricated object at the end of the construction phase. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">During this time, the photo mask is erased and prepared for the next layer. The hollow cavities which previously contained the liquid resin are now filled with a layer of hot liquid wax. This is cooled with a cold plate until it becomes brittle and then the layer is milled to its exact thickness, producing a flat solid surface ready to receive the next layer. The process carries on as described above, layer by layer, until the fabricated object is ready.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Depending on the requirements, parts fabricated using the Solider process can be vacuum cast, sand cast, investment cast or gypsum mould cast as follows:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Vacuum casting of plastic parts in silicone moulds</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> is the natural complement to the Solider process. The master, usually a Solider model, is given a high quality surface finish. It is then placed into a frame inside a vacuum chamber, where liquid de-aerated silicone is poured onto it, it is then hardened in a heating chamber, cut open, and the master is removed. Because the silicone is flexible, slight undercuts can be accommodated during the demoulding process. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">By inserting metal slides, more complex moulds can be made. (Each mould can be typically used for 10-30 castings.) The silicone mould then serves as the casting mould for two liquid component resins which are mixed under controlled conditions in the vacuum chamber. After casting, the resins can be solidified in a heating chamber and the parts can be removed from the silicon mould. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">There are a wide range of casting materials and dyes available. The mechanical-thermal specifications of the polyurethane material closely approximate the properties of many thermoplastics. The final product's surface quality and the reproduction of details is good.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Sand casting</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> is mainly used for making aluminium, grey-cast iron and magnesium parts. In the case of components of relatively low complexity the Solider model is split using the CAD system. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">At the same time the material dependent shrinkage scale is taken into consideration and is built into the geometry of the model. In the case of complex parts, pattern equipment can be made by embedding the Solider part into an epoxy-resin mould. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Using this technique, a typical production period for sand casting from data to end product can be as short as a few weeks and the surface quality is within standard ISO requirements.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Investment casting, or lost wax casting</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> requires a master whose dimensions are calculated to compensate for shrinkage and which is produced by the Solider process. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">A mould is then made in an epoxy resin insert which is embedded in an aluminium block. In the case of a relatively simple part this is a two-piece mould which can be completed around metal or resin cores. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Wax models are made by injecting wax into the mould and when following conventional methods, inserted into a run and feed system and poured using the ingot casting technique. The process is applied for aluminium, magnesium, brass and bronze parts and the surface quality is within standard ISO requirements.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Gypsum mould casting</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> can be applied to relatively large aluminium parts with similar surface qualities to that of the lost wax, or investment casting process. In gypsum mould casting, using two-fold moulding, split positive silicon moulds are produced from a Solider model fabricated in accordance with the shrinkage scale of the metal type to be used. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This pattern differs from the original model, in that it is split into separate segments. Then using the silicon mould, split negative moulds are produced. These serve as the lost moulds. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Then the gypsum moulds are assembled and after a controlled drying process, typically lasting several hours, are pointed and used for casting. This method allows components to be produced within die casting tolerances, with a wall thickness of less than 3 mm and a maximum construction length of approximately 500 mm.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The basic principle of the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) process is that a very thin layer of heat-fusible powder is spread in a container, representing the working space, which is then heated to just below its melting point by a laser beam.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), developed by Stratasys Inc. (USA), is a rapid prototyping technology which safely and quickly generates accurate physical models. In this process a conceptual geometric model is created on the CAD system, which is then imported into a UNIX-based workstation where it is sliced into horizontal layers that are downloaded to the FDM machine, the 3D MODELER.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The principle of operation is that a semi-liquid thermoplastic material is extruded and then deposited into ultra-thin layers from the lightweight FDM head one layer at a time. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This process gradually builds up the model upwards from a fixtureless platform. Each layer bonds to the previous layer as the thermoplastic material solidifies in about a tenth of a second. A spool of 0.050 inch (approx. 1.27 mm) diameter modelling filament feeds the FDM head. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Model materials can be changed over in a few minutes. The part can be rendered in one of three different materials, these being: durable plastic polymer, investment casting wax or machinable wax.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Maintaining the semiliquid modelling material just above the solidification point is vital to the FDM process. The thermoplastic melt temperature is controlled to 1 degree Fahrenheit above solidification. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The material then solidifies as it is directed into place with an x/y controlled extruding head nozzle that creates a precision laminate. Successive laminations (i.e. layers) are within 0.001 to 0.030 inch (0.0254 mm to 0.762 mm) thickness range with a wall thickness of 0.009 to 0.250 inches (0.2286 mm to 6.35 mm). </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">They adhere to one another through thermal fusion to form the model. The Stratasys machine maintains an overall tolerance of +/-0.005 inches (+/-0.127 mm) in the x, y, z axis over the entire 12 inch (304.8 mm) cubed working envelope. Repeatability measures how closely the machine can run the same part 100 times remaining within tolerance and resolution. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">According to the manufacturer, the Stratasys 3D MODELER holds repeatability to +/-0.001 inches (+/-0.0254 mm).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Speed is an important benefit of this technology and since no postcuring is necessary, the FDM process enables the designer to create multiple versions of a part design within a few minutes to an hour. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Since the process operates at moderate temperatures in the range of approximately 180 to 220 degrees of Fahrenheit (approximately 80 to 100 degrees Celsius) desktop or design office use is safe. According to company sources, when operating the machine, there is no possible exposure to toxic chemicals, lasers or liquid polymer baths. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The Stratasys process utilises no powders and there is no messy cleanup, thus there should be no concern over the disposal of hazardous materials.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The Stratasys 3D MODELER machine has the ability to create a support in mid-air rather than building the support up from the base, as is the case in some rapid prototypes. The system is also capable of extruding plastic into free space depending on the part geometry. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When supports are not needed, the FDM head forms a precision horizontal support in mid-air as it solidifies.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The basic principle of Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) is that the 2D cross section of the 3D solid or surface model is traced by a laser beam that layer by layer cuts out the appropriate shape of a foil-type material supplied on a roll. Having cut a layer, the foil is transferred by a mechanism and the cut layers are glued together to form a solid object at the end of the process.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">A typical process sequence can be described as follows:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">1. The computer of the Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) slices the 3D object model into 2D slices</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> that are of the thickness of the chosen foil.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">2. The computer guides the laser beam along the geometry</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> of the cross section and cuts the foil through exactly to its thickness. The access foil material is usually cross hatched by the laser beam and removed from the area.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">3. The platform jogs down by the thickness of the foil.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> The foil moves and is bonded to the previous layer.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">4. The laser beam cuts the new section and the process continues</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> until the part is finished.</font></p>
					<font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">To summarize, let us emphasise, that rapid prototyping is an exciting and fast moving technology because in comparison with other conventional methods it can create complex, interlocked physical objects of 3D CAD solid or surface models within a few minutes to a few hours, depending on part complexity and size. </font>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Due to the size of the growing rapid prototyping market, estimated to be over US$100 million a year, there are likely to be further improvements and new methods emerging into the marketplace, including very low cost, good quality machines for desktop design and manufacturing, better surface quality, faster speed, more user-friendly computer control systems, more automated and more stable processes.</font></p>
