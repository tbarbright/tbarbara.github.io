					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We illustrate a simplified, CE model, with design, manufacturing, marketing and other CE functions embedded into a factory. A model like this can be very beneficial to identify information flow problems, redundancies, lack of communication between certain processes,such as design and procurement information flows, the way suppliers interact with the CE teams, or with design and manufacturing engineers, quality control engineers, and others.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Note, that the model is drawn as a DFD, a Dataflow Diagram. By following this notation, ellipses are processes, boxes are data sources and/or data sinks, and parallel lines are data stores. The dataflow is indicated by lines with arrows. (Note, that this is not a flowchart, since the processes can fire simultaneously.)</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Based on the illustrated model, and the ISO TQM Principles discussed in this Chapter, try to identify key CE processes, that suppliers will have to interact with when dealing with product / process / service quality issues in an organization. Then try to identify the way you would create a mutually beneficial, quality supplier / factory / enterprise relationship information flow. (Note, that in <a href="Ch05_TQM_SysModeling.html">Chapter 5</a> of this eBook we offer a more sophisticated CE system architectur model.)</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">According to the official ISO statements, </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'ISO&rsquo;s role has evolved over the first fifty years of its existence and will no doubt continue to do so in the future. ISO and US standardization bodies are assential for design compatibility, safety, quality, ergonomics, ecology, environmental and many other aspects.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Through the decisions of the Council, ISO responds to its members&rsquo; wishes; they in turn respond to the market&rsquo;s, and thus when new requirements come to be felt for more streamlined procedures to develop normative documents specifically for committees for whom speed is all-important, ISO has responded by developing new products (meaning standards) to cater for these needs.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">When ISO was created in 1947, its objective was essentially to provide recommendations to its members aimed at harmonizing national standards, and for the first 25 years of its existence, the results of ISO&rsquo;s technical work were published as ISO Recommendations.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It was in the </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">early 1970s that ISO began to publish International Standards... </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">(very, very late, agreed?)</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">By the early 1980s, ISO was starting to be accepted and ISO standards had their own validity in the marketplace. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Towards the latter part of the decade we saw the first signs of what has come to be known as the globalization of markets. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Not only were ISO standards starting to establish their own validity in the marketplace, but in many instances ISO was being asked to prepare the first standards on particular topics, and was consequently moving away from its original mission of harmonizing national standards...'</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Since global markets need international standards, the future of ISO, as well as other national (meaning U.S. and other national) as well as international standardization efforts are assured.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">QS-9000 represents the requirements and recommendations that apply to the organizations that supply the product, or service, and hence affect the manner in which the products and services are designed, manufactured, installed, and delivered. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">They are standards, that apply to the management of the organization and only the management can and should decide how it will respond to these requirements and recommendations.</font></p>
