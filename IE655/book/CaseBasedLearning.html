					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The purpose of this 3D eBook in a CBL/ PBL format is to be able to </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">work with, and learn from real-life design  problems</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">with a quality focus, with the intention of getting things done</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> using sound methods, technologies and peer group experience as support mechanisms. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In other words, case -based, or problem-based learning, at its most fundamental level, is an instructional method characterized by the use of 'real world' problems as a context for students to learn critical thinking and problem solving skills, and acquire knowledge of the essential concepts of the course.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In the most advanced environment, CBL or PBL is performed using </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">web-enabled, interactive videos, active code, animation and 3DVR interactive multimedia</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> (as in this program) with optional on-line tutor support in an asynchronous fashion. (In other words, decoupled from a fixed schedule and set speed live classroom, enabling enjoyable interactive and feedback controlled learning and problem solving literally anywhere, anytime).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Case -based, or problem-based learning can be very </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">interdisciplinary</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, ranging from various hardware and software aspects to integrated systems of networked computers, design and management/ production control and even environmental issues; justifying the fact that the real-world is an integrated whole... meaning that everything relates to everything.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This interdisciplinary, open ended nature makes CBL/ PBL interesting, as well as challenging for all of us, i.e. learners as well as program creators. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The driving force behind case-based learning is the acceptance of the fact that hard working, diligent and honest </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">students should be viewed as the most important asset of a society</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, rather than cost, as many governments in many parts of the world unfortunately got it wrong...</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Our methodology does NOT follow the typical textbook case in which all the methods are presented, the sample values/ data are well tuned and balanced and there is definitely one solution only... This is exciting as well as challenging.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">We follow an approach that </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">mimics real-world professional engineering problem solving methods</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> as close as possible in an open source, networked virtual team environment, meaning that you can work with the expert(s) on your screen, using various techniques, most importantly </font></p>

					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In our CBL/ PBL library we follow an object oriented design, therefore our open systems and open source architecture includes the following key principles:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Case-based library programs are </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">self contained objects</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> built of objects and components. Often these objects and components are text, high </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">quality images, interactive digital video, animation, 3DVR and animated 360 degree panoramas. </font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">They are open source, web-enabled, delivered on CD-ROM or DVD (to overcome transfer rate and in some countries expensive web-access bottlenecks) or </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">fast company intranets, the new emerging opportunity</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> for continuous professional development.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The way </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">we present challenges are similar to the way professional engineers solve problems.</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> This is because we </font>
							<ul>
								<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">first look at the real-world customer requirement, then </font>
								<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">we offer one or more solutions by explaining real-world machines, or processes, or systems, or management tasks and then </font>
								<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">we discuss further development, service, maintenance, integration, connectivity and many other issues with several feedback loops. </font>
							</ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Notice that we do NOT follow the traditional linear, or sequential, but rather the modern, customer driven, </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">concurrent, object oriented approach to integrated product/ process design.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In terms of delivering our cases we follow the </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Virtual Product Demo</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> concept, in that we virtually take you with us to factories, R&amp;D studios, exhibitions and laboratories and give you interesting demos explained by real-world experts who have actually done it ! </font>
						<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In all cases we show you high quality, interactive videos and often 3D objects and 360 degree interactive panoramas so that you can interrogate objects, enjoy virtual factory or facility tours and even participate actively by e-mail.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In terms of challenging you to learn and investigate the illustrated case(s) further </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">we give you several direct URL (web) contacts, e-mail addresses </font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">so that you can get in touch with anybody over the web, including any of us who have created/ presented the cases.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Furthermore for case-based marketing we have included </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">e-mailable short video clips</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> that you can distribute to potential customers as part of your 21st century hi-tech tool-set. (Please </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><a href="eMailVideoClips.html"><font color="blue">look up the instructions</font></a></font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> before e-mailing attached clips).</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">We focus our questions and address </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">exciting engineering, management, and computing science/ IT (Information Technology) issues</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">. This approach helps distance learners as well as educators to work with the material in real-world classroom and/or virtually web-networked teams.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Our cases are object-oriented and self contained, nevertheless </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">can be integrated/ grouped </font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">into different classes of objects in a lean and flexible way (just as a modern software program, or a modern manufacturing/ assembly system can be integrated into different environments). This enables learners as well as tutors and managers to 'plug-and-play' our cases in the way they choose to, rather than the way the author meant it... </font>
						<li><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The methodology we follow enables </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">basic knowledge transfer</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> enabled with </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">3DVR interactive multimedia</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">. It is </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">highly interactive</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">collaborative</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> and enables large groups as well as individuals to gain the same knowledge effectively anywhere, anytime.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" color="maroon" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Some More Challenges...</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">It is important to realize that case-based learning and case -based marketing go hand in hand,</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> although this technique is not for everybody because the problems as well as the solutions are interdisciplinary, often open-ended and can get complex. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">On the other hand in all cases this method will enhance, support and enable a wide range of interactions with real-world challenges, and therefore represents integrated multi-disciplinary problem solving opportunities for our engineering, computer science and management students, for professionals in industry, as well as for potential customers eager to educate themselves and then take good decisions. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="maroon" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Our Outcome-oriented Challenges</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Case-based learning is an effective method for outcome-oriented problem solving and assessment because it forces both the student as well as the tutor to focus and create. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Within the framework of our open source, object-oriented, multimedia case-based learning library we</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> encourage outcome-oriented educational practices and follow ABET principles (The Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology, USA).
