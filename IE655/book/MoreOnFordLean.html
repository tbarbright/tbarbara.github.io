We've transformed our plants to bring more products, faster to our customers,&quot; said Matt DeMars, Ford vice president, Vehicle Operations. &quot;Our goal is to </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">build stability and standardization into our North American assembly and stamping plants, which is what flexible and lean manufacturing is all about.&quot;<br>			</font><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><br>				 Ford has launched a record number of vehicles this year &#150; and is on track to meet its commitment of introducing </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">flexible manufacturing into 75% </font><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">of its body shops, trim and final assembly operations by the end of the decade. </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Flexibility in the body shop is the most important component of flexible manufacturing</font><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"> because of the complexity and cost of the operation. Ford's new flexible body shop system costs less than both traditional body shops and other flexible systems.<br>				<br>				Ford kicked off an aggressive launch year with production of the F-150 at the Dearborn Truck Plant; the Ford GT at the Wixom Assembly Plant; the Escape Hybrid at the Kansas City Assembly Plant; the Ford Five Hundred, Freestyle and Mercury Montego in Chicago; the Mercury Mariner at the Ohio Assembly Plant; and the Ford Mustang at AutoAlliance International.<br>				<br>				 DeMars attributes their launch successes to the </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Company's focus on quality, processes &#150; and the people</font><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"> who build the vehicles.<br>				<br>				 &quot;We are committed to getting our launches right.
