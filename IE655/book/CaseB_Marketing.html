					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">By <b>focusing on quality design and manufacture in an integrated fashion</b>, and then finding out, and then capturing what customers want, need, or desire, and truly require is essential for every business to survive and prosper.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Furthermore, getting information about new products and/ or services across a customer base is one of the greatest challenges of mankind. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Since information, presented in a clear and meaningful manner is the key to progress, an organization&rsquo;s success often depends on its ability to communicate.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Our methods and tools, presented in this simulated 3D multimedia eBook program</font><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> help quality-focused product / process, </font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">marketing and sales engineers, product / process and system design engineers and manufacturers, and even after sales support and maintenance engineers, and IT experts</font><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> winning new customers.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">National and international competition forces marketing engineers, designers, manufacturers, demanufacturers, IT engineers, and managers to continuously innovate, collaborate and make their product / process design and manufacturing processes market driven. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This means that marketing and sales departments have to find out what their customer needs, wants, desires and requirements are, and then explain and sell their increasingly more complex products to an increasingly more educated and globally distributed, Internet-ready customer base at a competitive price, and in a short time.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In other words, we have to continuously learn about new customer / user needs, because this drives the innovative process, then create, and simultaneously market new products and / or services.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">On the top of all this globalization, and the Internet is changing everything. Companies are designing on an international basis, manufacturing / assembling / maintaining and selling their products directly to well informed global customers over the web 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Simultaneously <b>the time to market is rapidly shrinking, and the appetite for new, reasonably priced quality products and services is growing. This is why the 'cost of change', 'getting it right the first time', </b>(see again our <a href="MoreMedia2/CostOfEngChanges.jpg">popular diagram</a>) are essential to simultaneously keep quality high, and cost law... and this can be achieved by means of quality design following CE / PLM principles, methods and tools.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The question in any product design / manufacturing business is who will find out what the customers want, need, and require, and then who will satisfy these requirements first?</b>... because whoever succeeds will get the business!</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>We can safely state: You!</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> ... if you are using our methods and tools as professionals should do!</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The extended QFD (Quality Function Deployment) and our CORA Tool (Component Oriented Requirements Analysis), coupled with our Virtual Product Demonstrator is an interactive multimedia, open source, 3DVR web enabled program that promotes the fact that Case Based Learning and Case Based Marketing go hand-in-hand, and electronically support a variety of fields and collaborative interests.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Our integrated methodology and toolset can be used as a vehicle to drive a market driven engineering process, that is truly customer focused. </font></p>
					<p><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Following our approach, customer needs, expectations, desires, wants and requirements are analyzed following an analytical approach, and then the results are used for product / process / service system design, quality and process specifications.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To summarize, our modern, market-driven, integrated product and process design and marketing approach enables the following:</font></p>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Marketing and sales engineers can capture customer needs, and demonstrate their products in an </font><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">interactive and non-linear</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> fashion. (Remember those marketing CDs that you cannot stop... and they just tell the story they want to hammer into you, versus what you are really interested in...and you cannot stop them and jump somewhere else...frustrated? Well, our solution is web-browser readable, interactive multimedia with high quality interactive videos and optional 3DVR (3 dimensional virtual reality) objects that you can interrogate. Often we add 360 degree virtual tours that are fascinating and often incredible, because they link 3D worlds together, and you can interactively navigate in these worlds.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Potential customers </font><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">can learn about products/ processes/ systems</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> and potential buyers can review them in-depth.</font>

						<li><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Marketing engineers can focus on the best probable deals,</font><font color="black" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> put all their resources and prioritize them using seamlessly shared marketing information in interactive 3DVR multimedia format across a global sales team.</font>
						<li><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Undergraduate and graduate engineering, pharmaceutical engineers, management and computer science, IT/IS students</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> can understand and learn from integrated product and process / service design issues by enjoying interactive, real cases presented by real experts, to whom they can actually e-mail and feed back their comments.</font>
						<li><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Product design and manufacturing engineers, system integrators, marketing and sales engineers</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> can analyze and learn innovation, collaborative design, system integration, maintenance and other challenges that the virtual demonstration of such products can collect, as well as</font>

This will enable them to close deals quicker and simultaneously increase customer satisfaction.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As a result, the </font><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">competitive advantage</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> gained is enormous because for a company empowered with the VPD (Virtual Product Demonstrator) tool-set the time it will take to demonstrate and market a new product on the Internet, or via CD-ROMs and DVDs will collapse to that of the fraction it takes and costs without it. This will result in retaining </font><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">satisfied customers</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, who can become </font><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">virtual members of the next product design team, or even community!</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> (Note, that we are all in the same boat... even if some of the input is virtual).</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Furthermore with the added </font><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">product intelligence gathered from customers</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, and potential customers, innovation will accelerate and designs and services will improve because everybody will learn from the focused and targeted market intelligence feedback.</font></p>
					<p><font color="maroon" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>A Hi-tech Marketing Strategy...</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In terms of marketing your advanced, hi-tech product, product design, manufacturing, assembly, or disassembly service, consider that the major opportunities for gaining competitive advantage will have their roots in one or more of the following major changes in the way we design and manufacture goods and offer services already, or in the (near) future:</font></p>
					<ol>
						<li><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Internationalization and globalization:</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> overseas markets (i.e. customers!) and enterprises have/ will have a major influence on everything we do.</font>
						<li><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The continuously changing customer requirements</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, sales and service networks will have a major effect on all of us. (The Internet is already a major opportunity!) This is why it is essential to inform and involve potential customers by taking them through virtual product and factory tours that have on-line feedback opportunities over the web (as it is the case with this program).</font>
						<li><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Competitiveness</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> through quality, consistency, leanness, agility, and partnerships is and will increasingly be key. There is literally no company in the world that can research, develop, manufacture and maintain all of its product components and sub-systems, therefore companies have to become increasingly competent systems integrators and value added releasers. Note, that </font><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">our CORA Tool can identify your position in a competitive world, including indicators where you should improve. </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Never forget though, that it is a dynamic world, therefore the CORA (and other analysis) should be kept up-to-date with the dynamically changing requirements and engineering solutions...</font>
						<li><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The importance of enthusiastic people who have drive and skills, motivation, leadership skills, teamwork interest, learning skills, knowledge and innovation</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> cannot be underestimated in our Internet-linked interactive multimedia world, in which one can invent and create a product and/or service and sell it 'anywhere and anytime' in the world! </font>

Note, that one of the major benefits of our Virtual Product Demo approach is that the potential customer can become part of the design and even the sales team over the web! Consider the speed at which you can get valuable feedback; not to mention the costs savings...</font>
						<li><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The responsiveness to environmental concerns</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> and regulations that has gained strong ground in Europe (notably the ISO 14000x environmental standard, the 'computer take-back' movement, and others) is spreading to the rest of the world, creating new business opportunities, more environmentally conscious green design and manufacturing / demanufacturing / disassembly practices, and simultaneously putting pressure on some existing, polluting processes and entire industries. (Consider the business opportunities when systems change from analogue to digital, like television...)</font>
						<li><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The influence of information technology and communications will be very significant,</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> most importantly the Internet and related interactive multimedia and 3DVR (three dimensional virtual reality) web and CD /DVD delivered interactive marketing and learning opportunities, such as Virtual Product Demos, disassembly virtual factory tours, the 'anything, anywhere, anytime' concepts, e-commerce for harvested products, services and even electronic banking, distance and on-line education, maintenance and many others.</font>
