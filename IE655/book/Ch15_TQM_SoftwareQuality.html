					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The purpose of this Chapter is to offer examples, methods, and validated solutions for </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">improving software and IT quality, in general. </font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This is essential, since</font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> CE, CAD/CAM and other engineering tools are software intensive.</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> If anything goes wrong with a real-world engineering product, process or service the CE engineers can be blamed and taken to court... software 'engineers' usually manage to escape... claiming, that it is 'not us', it is always 'somebody else's system that went wrong...'</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Respectfully, the truth is, that many software and IT products should not be on the market at all. They are that unreliable and bad.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Since literally every aspect of our lives is affected by software and IT, and the thinking, logic and culture programmed into increasingly 'intelligent' devices by respected, ethical, educated and experienced professionals, as well as by 'clicking engineers' who do not understand what they are actually doing, software, and IT quality is a truly BIG issue, and will be for many, many more years. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Globalization of this industry creates even more complex challenges, since all design, including software is cultural, therefore how can we realistically expect, that a bright software engineer in China or India will truly understand the way a US car rental system, the new GM Cadillac, or a gas supply maintenance operation, or a US cell-phone network, or a DVD rental operation in New York City, etc. works... On teh same token, how can a software engineer in California create a system for China, or India, or Europe ? </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In order to develop such systems, one needs to live and work with the users and understand all their needs. The core can and should be shared but the logic is in most cases different! This is part of our broader view of CE.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The feasible solution is to </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">treat software and IT just as any professional engineering challenge, and solve these problems accordingly, based on tested, robust engineering logic, and accurate CE requirements analysis, and <a href="MediaResources/UML.jpg">models</a>, such as UML (Unified Modeling Language). </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Unfortunately the software and IT community typically does not agree with this, claiming, that their science is only 50 or so years old, whereas recorded engineering science is over 12K years old.... this is true, nevertheless they should even more so adopt professional engineering solutions, since disasters are happening because of software and IT faults every day... The ultimate solution, is that this professional engineering-based approach, and teaching/learning process starts in the school system, at universities and companies teaching IT. Also we should hope, that eventually </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">market forces will drive out poor quality software and IT businesses, although there are big monopolies in this industry not willing to make a change...</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Literally every advanced electro-mechanical product today already has some level of IT and embedded, and/or networked software engineering content, that is critical to the function of such objects, devices and services. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This trend will continue, and with the advancement of wireless networked multimedia (also referred to as telematics), digital mobile / cell phones, and other safety, and mission-critical integrated software engineering solutions it is vital that we all work together on improving software and IT quality.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>The tragic fact is, that </b></font><font size="3" color="#dc143c" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>75-80% of software projects fail</b></font><font size="3" color="#ff00ff" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b> </b></font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>in the USA and elsewhere, where software is developed... (and this is the 21st Century Folks!)</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">We all know that the software business is in trouble... at present over 75-80 percent of software projects fail! (Ref. Rational, Inc., an IBM company since 2003, published in 1999, 2001, and in 2002). Therefore we need to focus on professional engineering TQM and Six-Sigma methods for software and IT too, including requirements analysis, and total quality modeling methods and tools, using object, and component- oriented software development methods.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As an example, can you imagine redesigning every component and system of an automobile every year? </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Of course not... despite this the software business is still redesigning many components every time they want to use them... </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This is because of the business drivers leading to the compensation of software writers, the rapid change of technology, because of poor quality, poor management, and most importantly lack of comprehensive methods, knowledge, and lack of total quality knowledge!</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The solution is that software developers have to learn TQM engineering problem solving methods with practical case studies. (Engineering is a 12,050 year plus old profession with good methods and experiences at all levels...) </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This is the only way they can begin to apply excellent quality controlled, object oriented principles, such as object reuse, encapsulation, inheritance and others. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">To recognize the importance of the object oriented methods based approach we follow in this eBook, please read what they have published in the eWeek magazine, and recognize that the software industry MUST become a professional software engineering industry using sound TQM methods:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">&quot;Software programmers hired by FedEX in recent months no longer operate in an environment where they</font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> simply write code for customer facing applications and throw it at us after they guess at what the customer needs.</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> They have a better understanding of the customers' needs because they have a more specific understanding of the industry in which they operate. They come out of school [meaning grad school] with the ability to communicate in a nontechnical way and operate as team players.&quot;</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">According to the New Jersey TechNews: </font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">'Continued growth in purchases (IT) and continued price/ performance improvements mean that there is a growing market for qualified staff. </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Skilled workers, who are adaptable, knowledgeable, and can work across multiple disciplines are always in need. </font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">For example last year it was reported by the ITAA (Information Technology Association of America) that there were over 800,000 unfilled jobs within the IT field in the USA only!.... The use of consultants to design and implement new systems is quite typical, but the need to run, maintain, upgrade and integrate them into business operations and procedures remains the job of an organization's staff.'</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Furthermore, eWeek (USA) states: </font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">'Networking skills are crucial. Networking experienced the hottest growth, at 24 percent, of any job category, according to the 2002 Salary Guide Survey of 1,650 CEOs. In the 2001 Pay index, salaries </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">for networking jobs, specifically engineering and operations jobs, were the two highest growth areas...</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> networking skills will always be hot because they are a crucial ingredient that enterprises need as they continue to build vital business connections... including business-to-business collaborations (B2B) on a global basis...

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">IEE News, states:</font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> 'The UK is suffering from a computer science brain drain.</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Industry in the UK and elsewhere (in Europe) are eager to hire talented people.

The highest employment rates were for accountancy and civil engineering graduates, followed by IT, business and management studies and media studies...'</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As a further example, reflecting the state of software and IT quality, Chairman and Chief Software Architect, Bill Gates, issued an internal memo to his staff: </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Every few years I have sent out a memo talking about the highest priority for Microsoft. Two years ago, it was the kickoff of our .NET strategy. Before that, it was several memos about the importance of the Internet to our future and the ways we could make the Internet truly useful for people. Over the last year it has become clear that ensuring .NET is a platform for <b>Trustworthy Computing</b> is more important than any other part of our work. If we don't do this, people simply won't be willing-or able-to take advantage of all the other great work we do. Trustworthy Computing is the highest priority for all the work we are doing. We must lead the industry to a whole new level of Trustworthiness in computing.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When we started work on Microsoft .NET more than two years ago, we set a new direction for the company-and articulated a new way to think about our software. Rather than developing standalone applications and Web sites, today we're moving towards smart clients with rich user interfaces interacting with Web services. We're driving the XML Web services standards so that systems from all vendors can share information, while working to make Windows the best client and server for this new era.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">There is a lot of excitement about what this architecture makes possible. It allows the dreams about e-business that have been hyped over the last few years to become a reality. It enables people to collaborate in new ways, including how they read, communicate, share annotations, analyze information and meet.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">However, even more important than any of these new capabilities is the fact that it is designed from the ground up to deliver Trustworthy Computing. What I mean by this is that customers will always be able to rely on these systems to be available and to secure their information. Trustworthy Computing is computing that is as available, reliable and secure as electricity, water services and telephony.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Today, in the developed world, we do not worry about electricity and water services being available. With telephony, we rely both on its availability and its security for conducting highly confidential business transactions without worrying that information about who we call or what we say will be compromised. Computing falls well short of this, ranging from the individual user who isn't willing to add a new application because it might destabilize their system, to a corporation that moves slowly to embrace e-business because today's platforms don't make the grade.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The events of last year-from September's terrorist attacks to a number of malicious and highly publicized computer viruses-reminded every one of us how important it is to ensure the integrity and security of our critical infrastructure, whether it's the airlines or computer systems.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Computing is already an important part of many people's lives. Within ten years, it will be an integral and indispensable part of almost everything we do. Microsoft and the computer industry will only succeed in that world if CIOs, consumers and everyone else sees that Microsoft has created a platform for Trustworthy Computing.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Every week there are reports of newly discovered security problems in all kinds of software, from individual applications and services to Windows, Linux, Unix and other platforms. We have done a great job of having teams work around the clock to deliver security fixes for any problems that arise. Our responsiveness has been unmatched-but as an industry leader we can and must do better. Our new design approaches need to dramatically reduce the number of such issues that come up in the software that Microsoft, its partners and its customers create. We need to make it automatic for customers to get the benefits of these fixes. Eventually, our software should be so fundamentally secure that customers never even worry about it.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">No Trustworthy Computing platform exists today. It is only in the context of the basic redesign we have done around .NET that we can achieve this. The key design decisions we made around .NET include the advances we need to deliver on this vision. Visual Studio .NET is the first multi-language tool that is optimized for the creation of secure code, so it is a key foundation element.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">I've spent the past few months working with Craig Mundie's group and others across the company to define what achieving Trustworthy Computing will entail, and to focus our efforts on building trust into every one of our products and services. Key aspects include:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Availability:</b> Our products should always be available when our customers need them. System outages should become a thing of the past because of a software architecture that supports redundancy and automatic recovery. Self-management should allow for service resumption without user intervention in almost every case.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Security:</b> The data our software and services store on behalf of our customers should be protected from harm and used or modified only in appropriate ways. Security models should be easy for developers to understand and build into their applications.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Privacy:</b> Users should be in control of how their data is used. Policies for information use should be clear to the user. Users should be in control of when and if they receive information to make best use of their time. It should be easy for users to specify appropriate use of their information including controlling the use of email they send.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Trustworthiness is a much broader concept than security, and winning our customers' trust involves more than just fixing bugs and achieving &quot;five-nines&quot; availability. It's a fundamental challenge that spans the entire computing ecosystem, from individual chips all the way to global Internet services. It's about smart software, services and industry-wide cooperation.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">There are many changes Microsoft needs to make as a company to ensure and keep our customers' trust at every level-from the way we develop software, to our support efforts, to our operational and business practices. As software has become ever more complex, interdependent and interconnected, our reputation as a company has in turn become more vulnerable. Flaws in a single Microsoft product, service or policy not only affect the quality of our platform and services overall, but also our customers' view of us as a company.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In recent months, we've stepped up programs and services that help us create better software and increase security for our customers. Last fall, we launched the Strategic Technology Protection Program, making software like IIS and Windows .NET Server secure by default, and educating our customers on how to get-and stay-secure. The error-reporting features built into Office XP and Windows XP are giving us a clear view of how to raise the level of reliability. The Office team is focused on training and processes that will anticipate and prevent security problems. In December, the Visual Studio .NET team conducted a comprehensive review of every aspect of their product for potential security issues. We will be conducting similarly intensive reviews in the Windows division and throughout the company in the coming months.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">At the same time, we're in the process of training all our developers in the latest secure coding techniques. We've also published books like &quot;Writing Secure Code,&quot; by Michael Howard and David LeBlanc, which gives all developers the tools they need to build secure software from the ground up. In addition, we must have even more highly trained sales, service and support people, along with offerings such as security assessments and broad security solutions. I encourage everyone at Microsoft to look at what we've done so far and think about how they can contribute.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">But we need to go much further.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In the past, we've made our software and services more compelling for users by adding new features and functionality, and by making our platform richly extensible. We've done a terrific job at that, but all those great features won't matter unless customers trust our software. So now, when we face a choice between adding features and resolving security issues, we need to choose security. Our products should emphasize security right out of the box, and we must constantly refine and improve that security as threats evolve. A good example of this is the changes we made in Outlook to avoid email borne viruses. If we discover a risk that a feature could compromise someone's privacy, that problem gets solved first. If there is any way we can better protect important data and minimize downtime, we should focus on this. These principles should apply at every stage of the development cycle of every kind of software we create, from operating systems and desktop applications to global Web services.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Going forward, we must develop technologies and policies that help businesses better manage ever larger networks of PCs, servers and other intelligent devices, knowing that their critical business systems are safe from harm. Systems will have to become self-managing and inherently resilient. We need to prepare now for the kind of software that will make this happen, and we must be the kind of company that people can rely on to deliver it.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This priority touches on all the software work we do. By delivering on Trustworthy Computing, customers will get dramatically more value out of our advances than they have in the past. The challenge here is one that Microsoft is uniquely suited to solve.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#006400" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">More discussion of our vision for Trustworthy Computing is in the internal white paper at &lt;\\itgweb3\news\TrustComp.doc</font></p>

It is called the 'Chaos Study'.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The study is trying to determine the scope of software project failures, the major factors that cause software projects to fail, and the key factors that can reduce project failures. The study involves 365 respondents and represented 8,380 applications. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In 1995, the Standish Group estimated that US development houses will spend 81 billion for cancelled software projects. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">They have found the following amazing data:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Only about 16% of the software and IT projects initiated by the responding companies will be completed successfully. (Success here is defined as on-time, on-budget, and covered functionalities for the customer).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">About 53% of the projects were over budget and behind schedule, while 31% were deemed failures (cancelled).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Cost overruns averaged 189% of the original cost estimate for all the projects.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Time overruns averaged 222% of the original time estimate. Only 61% of the originally specified features and functions (requirements) were available on the released project.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Re-starts were common on many of the failed projects</font>
					</ul>

He called the bug Dan-0411, and it is also known as the Pentium II and Pentium Pro FPU bug or the flag erratum (as it is referenced by Intel).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This bug occurs with operations that convert floating point numbers into integers. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Floating point numbers are stored in an 80-bit format, while integers are stored in 16-bits (for short integer) and 32-bits (for long integers). Sometimes, converting an 80-bit floating point number into an integer on the Pentium II and the Pentium Pro produces the Dan-0411 bug. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This happens when the converted floating point number won't fit into the smaller integer format. According to Intel's Flag Erratum Technical Description site, the erratum occurs only when the FIST[P] instruction is either a 16- or 32-bit operation; either the 'to nearest', 'to zero' or 'up' rounding modes are being used; the sign bit of the floating-point operand is negative; and the floating-point operand being converted is significantly more negative than can be described by the integer size being targeted.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When the operand is large enough that it would not fit into the target data size the processor is supposed to do the following:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When invalid operation exception is masked: </font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Return the MAXNEG value to memory.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Set the IE (Invalid Operation) bit in the Floating Point status word to flag the overflow.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Do not set the PE (precision error) bit the Floating Point status word.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When invalid operation exception is unmasked:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Do not return a result to memory. Keep the original operand intact on the stack.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Set the IE (Invalid Operation) bit in the Floating Point status word to flag the overflow.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Do not set the PE (precision error) bit the Floating Point status word.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Vector to the user numeric exception handler.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">However, in the case that the operand is large enough that it would not fit into the target data size, the processor responds with returning the MAXNEG value to memory; not setting the IE (Invalid Operation) bit in the Floating Point status word to flag the use of an invalid operand; setting the PE (precision error) bit the Floating Point status word; not invoking an exception handler; and in the case of a FISTP instruction the Operand will have been popped from the floating point stack (Flag Erratum Technical Description).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The good news was, that the chance of this bug occuring is 1 in 8.6 billion, when storing 16-bit integers, and 1 in 562,950 billion, when storing 32-bit integers. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The bug was not found in the Pentium and the Pentium MMX processors. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When talking about the bug Collins gives an interesting analogy about a launch failure of the Ariane 5 rocket, which happened because a floating point to integer conversion overflowed and the overflow was not handled right. However, the Pentium II and Pentium Pro FPU bug was found to be minor. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Most PC applications, such as word processors, data bases, most spreadsheets, and most games, do not use floating point math and can not be affected by the bug. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Further, most of the software vendors, such as Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, Netscape, and others, have indicated that the bug does not affect their products. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Intel has also suggested the following workarounds to avoid the occurence of the bug: </font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Range checking performed prior to execution of the FIST[P] instruction will prevent the overflow condition from occurring, and may already be implemented as a standard coding style.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Software can use the presence of MAXNEG in the result integer to indicate that an out of range conversion may have occurred.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Based on the knowledge that numbers capable of triggering this erratum have one of two properties (1) they have a fractional component OR (2) they are larger than the maximum signed 64 bit integer size.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">A combination of three instructions can be used in place of either a FISTP16 or a FISTP32 instruction that will allow the above errata to be worked around.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" color="white" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">According to th eofficial report, published by Inquiry Board (The Chairman of the Board: Prof. J. L. LIONS) on 4 June 1996, the maiden flight of the Ariane 5 launcher ended in a failure. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Only about 40 seconds after initiation of the flight sequence, at an altitude of about 3700 m, the launcher veered off its flight path, broke up and exploded. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Engineers from the Ariane 5 project teams of CNES and Industry immediately started to investigate the failure. Although the failure was due to a systematic software design error, mechanisms can be introduced to mitigate this type of problem. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">For example the computers within the SRIs could have continued to provide their best estimates of the required attitude information. There is reason for concern, that a software exception should be allowed, or even required, to cause a processor to halt while handling mission-critical equipment. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Indeed, the loss of a proper software function is hazardous because the same software runs in both SRI units. In the case of Ariane 501, this resulted in the switch-off of two still healthy critical units of equipment.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The original requirement acccounting for the continued operation of the alignment software after lift-off was brought forward more than 10 years ago for the earlier models of Ariane, in order to cope with the rather unlikely event of a hold in the count-down e.g. between - 9 seconds, when flight mode starts in the SRI of Ariane 4, and - 5 seconds when certain events are initiated in the launcher which take several hours to reset. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The period selected for this continued alignment operation, 50 seconds after the start of flight mode, was based on the time needed for the ground equipment to resume full control of the launcher in the event of a hold.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This special feature made it possible with the earlier versions of Ariane, to restart the count- down without waiting for normal alignment, which takes 45 minutes or more, so that a short launch window could still be used. In fact, this feature was used once, in 1989 on Flight 33.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Based on the extensive documentation and data on the Ariane 501 failure made available to the Board, the following chain of events, their inter-relations and causes have been established, starting with the destruction of the launcher and tracing back in time towards the primary cause.</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The launcher started to disintegrate at about H0 + 39 seconds because of high aerodynamic loads due to an angle of attack of more than 20 degrees that led to separation of the boosters from the main stage, in turn triggering the self-destruct system of the launcher.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This angle of attack was caused by full nozzle deflections of the solid boosters and the Vulcain main engine.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">These nozzle deflections were commanded by the On-Board Computer (OBC) software on the basis of data transmitted by the active Inertial Reference System (SRI 2). Part of these data at that time did not contain proper flight data, but showed a diagnostic bit pattern of the computer of the SRI 2, which was interpreted as flight data.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The reason why the active SRI 2 did not send correct attitude data was that the unit had declared a failure due to a software exception.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The OBC could not switch to the back-up SRI 1 because that unit had already ceased to function during the previous data cycle (72 milliseconds period) for the same reason as SRI 2.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The internal SRI software exception was caused during execution of a data conversion from 64-bit floating point to 16-bit signed integer value.The floating point number which was converted had a value greater than what could be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. This resulted in an Operand Error. The data conversion instructions (in Ada code) were not protected from causing an Operand Error, although other conversions of comparable variables in the same place in the code were protected</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The error occurred in a part of the software that only performs alignment of the strap-down inertial platform. This software module computes meaningful results only before lift-off. As soon as the launcher lifts off, this function serves no purpose.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The alignment function is operative for 50 seconds after starting of the Flight Mode of the SRIs which occurs at H0 - 3 seconds for Ariane 5. Consequently, when lift-off occurs, the function continues for approx. 40 seconds of flight. This time sequence is based on a requirement of Ariane 4 and is not required for Ariane 5</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The Operand Error occurred due to an unexpected high value of an internal alignment function result called BH, Horizontal Bias, related to the horizontal velocity sensed by the platform. This value is calculated as an indicator for alignment precision over time</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The value of BH was much higher than expected because the early part of the trajectory of Ariane 5 differs from that of Ariane 4 and results in considerably higher horizontal velocity values</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The several hundred pages long Report, amongst others, concluded the following:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">....The failure of the Ariane 501 was caused by the complete loss of guidance and attitude information 37 seconds after start of the main engine ignition sequence (30 seconds after lift- off). This loss of information was due to specification and design errors in the software of the inertial reference system.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The extensive reviews and tests carried out during the Ariane 5 Development Programme did not include adequate analysis and testing of the inertial reference system or of the complete flight control system, which could have detected the potential failure...</font></p>
