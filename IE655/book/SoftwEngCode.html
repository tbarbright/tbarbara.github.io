Software engineers are those who contribute by direct participation or by teaching, to the analysis, specification, design, development, certification, maintenance and testing of software systems. Because of their roles in developing software systems, software engineers have significant opportunities to do good or cause harm, to enable others to do good or cause harm, or to influence others to do good or cause harm. To ensure, as much as possible, that their efforts will be used for good, software engineers must commit themselves to making software engineering a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the following Code of Ethics and Professional Practice.</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The Code contains eight Principles related to the behavior of and decisions made by professional software engineers, including practitioners, educators, managers, supervisors and policy makers, as well as trainees and students of the profession. The Principles identify the ethically responsible relationships in which individuals, groups, and organizations participate and the primary obligations within these relationships. The Clauses of each Principle are illustrations of some of the obligations included in these relationships. These obligations are founded in the software engineer's humanity, in special care owed to people affected by the work of software engineers, and in the unique elements of the practice of software engineering. The Code prescribes these as obligations of anyone claiming to be or aspiring to be a software engineer.</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">It is not intended that the individual parts of the Code be used in isolation to justify errors of omission or commission. The list of Principles and Clauses is not exhaustive. The Clauses should not be read as separating the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical situations. The Code is not a simple ethical algorithm that generates ethical decisions. In some situations, standards may be in tension with each other or with standards from other sources. These situations require the software engineer to use ethical judgment to act in a manner, which is most consistent with the spirit of the Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, given the circumstances.</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful consideration of fundamental principles, rather than blind reliance on detailed regulations. These Principles should influence software engineers to consider broadly who is affected by their work; to examine if they and their colleagues are treating other human beings with due respect; to consider how the public, if reasonably well informed, would view their decisions; to analyze how the least empowered will be affected by their decisions; and to consider&nbsp; whether their acts would be judged worthy of the ideal professional working as a software engineer. In all these judgments concern for the health, safety and welfare of the public is primary; that is, the &quot;Public Interest&quot; is central to this Code.</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering requires a code that is adaptable and relevant to new situations as they occur.&nbsp; However, even in this generality, the Code provides support for software engineers and managers of software engineers who need to take positive action in a specific case by documenting the ethical stance of the profession. The Code provides an ethical foundation to which individuals within teams and the team as a whole can appeal. The Code helps to define those actions that are ethically improper to request of a software engineer or teams of software engineers.</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The Code is not simply for adjudicating the nature of questionable acts; it also has an important educational function. As this Code expresses the consensus of the profession on ethical issues, it is a means to educate both the public and aspiring professionals about the ethical obligations of all software engineers.</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font></p>		<h1><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">PRINCIPLES</font></h1>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font></p>		<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><b>Principle 1 PUBLIC</b> Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
