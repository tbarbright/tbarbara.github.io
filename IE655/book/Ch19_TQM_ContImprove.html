					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Since one of the fundamental purposes of TQM and TQC is to reduce process variation, these rules are very important. This is how you can get there:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As a result of the analysis of products and / or processes, or during the implementation of improvement projects, or customer defined Key Characteristics may indicate that process variation management activities are required in your organization. As we have seen, statistical process control charts can be an effective means of controlling variation and obtaining process knowledge, because they will help to establish mistake proof processes, develop upstream process controls, contribute to process and product redesign, and eventually reduce the reliance on control charts. The key issue, is to be able to identify, control, and optimize processes.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If a process is out-of- control, then this condition must be investigated and corrective action must be taken. If the process is out-of- control, because it is not capable, either because of operator training issues, or because of old / faulty technology, or other reasons, the organization must identify and control sources of variation and take corrective action.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In every factory, in every product, or part, or process, there are features whose variation have a strong effect on quality and waste. By means of process mapping, and risk analysis, these features should be identified as key characteristics, and variation in these processes should be controlled, and preferably reduced. (The reduction of variation in these features should lead to higher quality, lowered waste levels and costs, and greater customer satisfaction).</font>
