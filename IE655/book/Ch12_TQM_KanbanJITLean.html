					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The world of product, process and service system design is moving  at a fast pace... some aspects of it are even labelled as 'real-time dynamic', or JIT (just-in-time). This means that design (CE) related decisions must be taken fast and without error, often in a globally networked environment of design teams, suppliers, customers and competitors... The Industrial Internet of Things makes it even faster for all of us... good news, as well as new challenges!</font></p>

					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">What to produce, </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When to produce,</font>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">How to transport it. </font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The term Kanban emerged from the standard operations list. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">It came from the practice whereby foremen in separate workplaces would write their group's work content on slips of paper, and post them, along with other foremen's, to show what was going on. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The quantity to be produced, the time, methods, procedures and amount to be transported, where it is to be transported, the place to store it, the means of transportation and the type of containers to be used can all be known at a glance through the Kanban. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The Kanban system was designed to:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Apply standard operations at any time,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Give directions based on the actual conditions existing in the workplace,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Prevent addition of any unnecessary work for those engaged in start-up operations, and </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Prevent a deluge of paper which cannot serve as future source material.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The other function of Kanban is to move information with the actual material, component, or sub-assembly. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">If this condition can be maintained one can achieve the following benefits:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">No overproduction will occur,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Priority in production becomes obvious (when the Kanban for one item piles up, that is the item that must be produced first), and</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Control of actual material becomes easier.</font>
					</ul>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The Kanban rules offer tools to manage quality at the workplace effectively. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">We now summarize and explain the preconditions to be established and the six basic rules of Kanban:</font></p>
					<p><font size="4" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 1:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> <b>Do not pass on defective parts to the subsequent process, meaning that if a defective part is discovered measures must be taken immediately to prevent its recurrence. </b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The process that has produced the defective part must immediately discover it and report it to the cell controller, which then takes further decisions. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">To avoid the piling up of defective components, corrective actions must be taken immediately by the machines themselves (if they are capable of doing so) by the workforce, and the management. (<a href="MediaResources/RobotMT_JIT%20prodCell.jpg">Example cell</a> layout.)</font></p>
					<p><font size="4" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 2:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> <b>Draw parts and material at the time they are needed and in the required quantity. </b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This is a basic JIT (just-in-time) rule, meaning that no loss is to be generated by overproduction. </font></p>
					<p><font size="4" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 3:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> <b>Produce only as many as required by the subsequent process.</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This rule relates to the second one, with the extension that it is predicated on the condition that the process itself must restrict inventory to the absolute minimum. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In other words this rule also implies to produce the exact amount in the order required.</font></p>
					<p><font size="4" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 4:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> <b>Maintain equipment and workforce in such a way that parts can be produced at the time they are needed and in the quantity needed. Equalize production.</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="4" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 5:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> <b>Kanban is a means to fine tuning. For the workforce Kanban becomes the single source of information for manufacturing, material handling and transportation.</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="4" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 6:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> <b>Stabilize and rationalize the process.</b> </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Defective workparts exist only because there is </font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Not sufficient standardization,</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> in terms of agreed and set procedures, and processes, within pre-programmed and cost effective control variable values, and</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Rationalization</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> of the workplace. </font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">According to Kanban, waste, unevenness and unreasonableness create defective parts. In other words if the tools are right and the organization (including skilled people, and quality machinery) is sound, the probability of producing faulty parts and waste is usually very low.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">At Toyota they say that &quot;a manufacturer's profit can be found in the way he makes things&quot;. It reflects the philosophy of attaining cost reduction by the elimination of wasteful operations. </font></p>

					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Balance the production plan</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Make each lot size (or in other words, the batch size) as small as possible</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Produce only what is needed, when needed and in the quantity needed. (This is to ensure, that there will be no waste arising from neither overproduction, nor from excess capacity).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Make sure that everyone can understand where the problem is. If we know where the problem is, it is relatively easy to solve</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Clarify the purpose behind the task of problem solving. Probe into the true cause and offer a proper rather than a temporary solution</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Even if there is only one defective item, provide a corrective measure. </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Even if the defect occurs only once every thousand times, ascertain the facts. With these facts, the core of the problem can be found and steps can be taken to prevent recurrence of defects. This type of defect is harder to find than those that occur more frequently</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Move from work improvement to equipment improvement.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Toyota insists on carrying out the work improvement phase of improvement activities thoroughly before moving on to the equipment improvement phase.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Differentiate between man-hours and number of workers, and between labour saving and people saving. (For example, when automation devices are installed, there may be a labour saving of 0.9 worker. But if the process still requires 0.1 worker, the money spent does not result in reducing the number of workers. This is often erroneously looked upon as labour saving).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Regard an improvement activity completed only when the result sought in the initial goal is obtained. If the result cannot be obtained it is often that the work has been done without much thought being given to it. Confirm the result of implementation at the workplace, adjust all those parts inadequately done and confirm the result again. By repeating this process, a good result can be obtained through improvement</font>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The hands and legs have not entrusted their brains to the management division. Therefore, engineering must not act as if it were the commander-in-chief of the workplace. </font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">According to Toyota, and other progressive companies, for any manufacturing company the most desirable condition is to </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">reduce inventory</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Of course, it is practically impossible to have zero inventory, but is often set as a goal. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">One shouldn't forget that in order to achieve this in one factory, possibly the suppliers have to keep a reasonable inventory, or alternatively all of them have to work following lean manufacturing and JIT principles, empowered by dynamically adjustable supply-chain management systems. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Zero inventory is an aim; it is not easy to achieve in practice. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The rational level of inventory is furthermore influenced by seasonal effects, as well as by technology, security, and other factors, such as politics, oil supplies and industrial actions in international ports, and others.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">To conclude this thought and principle, what a company can and should do is to accept the &quot;zero inventory&quot; as a challenge and try to reduce the inventory as much as feasible for the particular business. </font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Toyota defines JIT as follows: &quot;Let the process have what is needed, when needed and in the quantity needed&quot;. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Automobiles, for example consist of thousands of parts. The number of processes required to manufacture a car are high. To harness all of these different processes and to engage them into a just-in-time production system is a very difficult task. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">To reach this goal in reality, </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">production plans have to be dynamically changed and one should rely on flexible cells and systems integrated into CIM (Computer Integrated Manufacturing).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Factors causing changes in production plans are numerous, including changing market conditions and varied factors affecting the manufacturer. When these factors are at work, and if a problem arises in the preceding process, the next process may find a shortage of parts and other items. Whether we like it or not, some subsequent processes may have to stop production or be forced to change plans.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">To summarize, to build quality into the product and into the processes involved, each worker must be responsible for each of the processes he performs, and must ensure the quality of each. Inspection must be brought within the process, and in order to send only good products to the subsequent process, defectives must be picked up on the spot.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Reasonably sized (i.e. small) cellular manufacturing systems, controlled by able, motivated and responsible humans and computers, as well as by principles and methods such as Kanban and JIT, help to create such a manufacturing enterprise.</font></p>

In other words, the central feature of Total Quality Management and Control, CIM (Computer Integrated Manufacturing), and lean production methods, is the elimination of waste in order to increase competitiveness, quality and productivity. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>CE, CIM, JIT and Total Quality Management</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Whether one considers CE, CIM (Computer Integrated Manufacturing), Total Quality or JIT first as a solution depends on where the main problems and opportunities are. The truth is that they all have to fit together well with each other, as well as with integrated product and process design (or, Concurrent Engineering), as well as administration and management.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">If one can see the chance of making a dramatic reduction in lead time, the first step will probably be to adopt a small CIM program within which JIT principles could be applied and then followed up with Total Quality Management, already building on the CIM (or networked, flexible, lean, digital factory) infrastructure. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In other words </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">CIM, JIT and Total Quality cannot be viewed in isolation. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">If the main opportunity for manufacturing improvement is through cutting the total cost of quality in the business, or if it is important to give the customers an improved perception of the quality of the business and products, then one should definitely go first for CIM, JIT and Total Quality.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As a general rule, as one implements Total Quality, the need for large inventories will disappear, and opportunities will open up for implementing a JIT philosophy. It is no accident that the Japanese started from the Total Quality ideas of Feigenbaum and Deming and went on to develop the concept of JIT and FMS/CIM (Flexible Manufacturing Cells and Systems, and digital factories).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">According to Professor J. Parnaby (Lucas Engineering &amp; Systems): </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">&quot;JIT methodology means the development of materials flow procedures wherein materials are supplied exactly at the time they are required to the point at which they are processed and have value added; it does not depend upon the purchase of high technology equipment. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">There may, of course, be areas where the production engineering of process changeovers require attention or where information technology in the form of personal or microcomputers can be applied to support the process. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">However, JIT is primarily a consequence of improved methodologies, not the application of high technology, and it starts from the viewpoint that everything actively constitutes a process capable of improvement to give better customer service and lower cost&quot;.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As PA International defines JIT, as an approach to scheduling which back schedules from the due date for an order, so that each operation takes place &quot;just in time&quot; to meet that date. </font></p>

					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>1.</b> It is fundamental </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">and when completed there can be no other comparable improvement since it completely tailors a manufacturing strategy to the needs of a market and produces mixed products in exactly the order required.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>2. </b>It requires a total systems approach</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> in which many aspects of the business have to be changed. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">It is not just a question of applying a particular technique but instead requires simultaneous changes based upon sound analysis and TQM management.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">All of the methods for monitoring and controlling factory processes and procedures, including day-to-day financial control,</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The whole organizational structure, i.e. reducing the large number of fragmented specialist departments and replacing these with integrated multidisciplinary departments capable of taking much more of an overall business viewpoint.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="maroon" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>JIT Rules in Practice<a name="Anchor-23240" id="Anchor-23240"></a></b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">According to Professor H. Wildemann, just-in-time production rules were introduced in Germany for four reasons. These are:</font></p>
					<p><b><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">1. Inventory in the logistic chain represents stored capacities.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> </font></b></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">It is more profitable to store capacities in capital assets than liquid assets. This requires regrouping individual items in the balance sheet. The goal is to aim for short throughput times and high flexibility.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>2. Inventories hide mistakes. </b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Optimizing a single function, such as purchasing, production, or sales, requires inventories. Only these safety stock inventories enable smooth production and prompt delivery to be achieved, and they compensate for unbalanced capacities, insufficient flexibility, scrap, and lack of delivery accuracy. If inventories are reduced, sources of error become apparent and there is immediate pressure to remove them. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This causes a permanent rationalization of the production process.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>3. Throughput time is an important indicator of manufacturing effectiveness.</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Short processing and supply times reduce the forecast period and improve flexibility changes in demand. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In many enterprises, the planning certainty of delivery dates is relatively low. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Some orders are completed before and some after the planned delivery date. The strategy of the production planning department is to reduce the dispersion of finishing dates by constant interventions in the production process. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">It is an established fact that this strategy has shown great success in many areas. Drastic reduction in throughput time is only possible by extensively changing the structure of production, i.e. through a selective decentralization of manufacturing functions into cellular systems and focusing on stronger product orientation. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This change in structure leads to a manufacturing segmentation that achieves flow optimization in certain segments and controls them so well that shop floor activities are transparent.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>4. There is no manufacturing structure with lower costs than continuous flow production. </b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This principle is applied to industrial production of individual and job-lot manufacturing by calculating daily lot sizes. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">It is connected to the introduction of organizational rules that maintain a continuous flow according to the following rule: produce every day only partial quantities of an order. Therefore, the continuous change of production represents a particular problem. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Strategies to minimize the set-up times as well as investments in flexible production techniques are attempts to synchronize different capacity units. </font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As a conclusion of what we have stated above, JIT production requires the application of the following basic ideas to the whole supply chain, including:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Job structures, meaning, that job descriptions and the scope of the responsibilities must be simple and offered with built-in flexibility (due to the established trust, this is feasible).</font>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Procedures for goal setting, project management to achieve targets and continuous improvement across departmental boundaries, following a total quality style is essential.</font>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Capital expenditure authorization procedures must be simplified and decisions must be taken at the level, where the most accurate information is available to take responsible decisions.</font>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Support for quality diagnosis and control should be implemented.</font>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Material flow control disciplines, e.g. containerized flow with very small batch size, or batch size one is essential.</font>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Factory scheduling and computer aided planning systems, integrated with dynamic simulation to adjust to real-time changes is essential.</font>
					</ul>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The development of JIT methods is a multidisciplinary team process and totally visible general management leadership is essential. It relies on new team approaches to factory operation with some clear specific aims.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Clear definition of the business ratio targets to be achieved for competitiveness, e.g. for stock turnover ratio, sales per employee, ratio of staff to direct workers, lead times, percent reduction of product cost and percentage return on sales and capital</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Cellular and lean manufacturing, assembly, and production in general, represents implementation reality for establishing a JIT method, following Kanban principles.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The fundamental thinking behind this is that every leading institution and small and large manufacturing company in the world is dealing with some aspects of flexible manufacturing and automation. This is because they have found that designing and making goods and products &quot;to order&quot; rather than &quot;for stock&quot;, is the key issue in cutting manufacturing costs and lead time and eventually stay in business in the future. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Flexible Manufacturing Cells and Systems (FMCs and FMSs) in this sense are offering the JIT and lean fabrication facilities and technologies with sophisticated quality control feedback loops.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">FMS may be defined as a reprogrammable manufacturing system in its broadest sense, dealing with high level distributed data processing and automated material flow, using highly flexible, computer controlled (and in some cases manually operated) material and information processors within an integrated, multi-layered feedback control architecture.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The benefits of FMS within a CIM system can be summarized as follows:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">1. Increased productivity</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> (often by a factor of 2 to 3.5).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">2. Decreased production costs</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> (often by 50%).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">3. Decreased inventory</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> and work-in-progress (WIP) to a level lower than ever before.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As we have discussed, Kanban is an </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">automated directional method and device</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> that gives information concerning </font></p>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When to produce, in</font>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">How to transport it. </font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Kanban rules offer tools to manage quality at the workplace effectively, clearly highlighted by the six basic rules of Kanban:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 1:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Do not pass on defective parts to the subsequent process, meaning that if a defective part is discovered measures must be taken immediately to prevent its recurrence. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This means, that the process that has produced the defective part must immediately discover it and report it to the cell controller, which then takes further decisions. (Note, that this messaging service is often executed in real-time, meaning in a few mili- seconds, therefore in most cases computers can do this type of job better and faster, than human operators. Obviously more intelligent jobs should be performed by humans in every system).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">To avoid the piling up of defective components, corrective actions must be taken immediately by the machines themselves (if they are capable of doing so) by the workforce, and the management.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 2:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Draw parts and material at the time they are needed and in the required quantity. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This is a basic JIT (just-in-time) rule, meaning that no loss is to be generated by overproduction. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 3:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Produce only as many as required by the subsequent process.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This rule relates to the second one, with the extension that it is predicated on the condition that the process itself must restrict inventory to the absolute minimum. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In other words this rule also implies to produce the exact amount in the order required.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 4:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Maintain equipment and workforce in such a way that parts can be produced at the time they are needed and in the quantity needed. Equalize production.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 5:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Kanban is a means to fine tuning. For the workforce Kanban becomes the single source of information for manufacturing, material handling and transportation.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Rule 6:</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Stabilize and rationalize the process. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Since </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">everything relates to everything</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, the key issue in this Chapter is how do the learned methods integrate for the benefit of TQM?</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>QS.2:</b> What are the process parameters and the typical values of the parameters? What are their limitations? How can you find reliable data to accomplish this study?</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>QS.3:</b> What kinds of devices and then architectures can you specify to achieve these goals, and why?</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>QS.4:</b> What is the scope of Kanban, JIT, and lean / flexible manufacturing / production? (Give examples).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>QS.5:</b> What is the likely cost, and savings when introducing the above discussed methods?... and what is the ROI (Return on investment)?</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>QS.6:</b> What functionality would you include in a low-end, middle-tear, and top-of the line Kanban / JIT / Lean package? Explain why?</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>QS.7:</b> What software platform would you chose to develop solutions? Explain why?</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>QS.8:</b> What are the major process steps, in the process flow, from concept to prototype, when developing a Kanban / JIT / Lean architecture and solution for a factory, office, or service?</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There are two main zones of JIT operation which can be developed either sequentially or in parallel:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">1. Within the factory, i.e. where material and information is delivered from one machine to the next, or from one cell to its customer in the correct order of variety and at exactly the time it is needed with the very minimum of buffer stores.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">2. Between the factory and its outside environment, meaning:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Between the factory and its suppliers - this requires the suppliers to redesign their factories and interface systems as in 1 above; and</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Between the factory and its customers - here customers pull-off the mix of products they require as they require them. This pulling-off process creates the Kanban card circulation back inside the factory following the sell-daily make-daily concept.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The fact that a company feels that it is likely to be a difficult and long term process to get its suppliers operating JIT is no excuse for not developing internal Zone 1 JIT procedures, since the benefits of internal JIT procedures are very great in their own right.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To summarize, the achievable results are very impressive, and include the following (reported by several technical directors of factories operating under JIT principles in the USA, Japan, as well as in Europe):</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">1. All levels of management trained in manufacturing systems engineering and a manufacturing systems engineering development function is installed.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">2. Complex production flow systems are simplified and a new factory architecture is set up comprising cellular production units and one service unit. Product range rationalized and simplified to reduce obsolete or non-contributing varieties.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">3. Average lead-times for manufacture reduced from 5 days to 35 minutes.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">4. No-value-added and wasteful activities reduced by 60%.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">5. Supplier development system introduced and 30% reduction in complexity achieved.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">6. Process changeover times reduced to a maximum of 5 minutes.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">7. U-shaped Kanban cells with job rotation flexibility introduced to replace a traditional linear push system with specialized jobs.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">8. Piecework removed and productivity (standard hours / direct operators hours) increased by 35%.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">9. Personnel reduced by 350.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">10. New cellular business-within-a-business organizational structure with fewer layers and flexible jobs.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">11. Quality circles for continuing operational improvement.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">12. Overall stocks reduced by &pound;3.5m. In-cell WIP reduced by 99%.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">13. Kanban container batch size of one unit.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">14. All managers and operating staff trained on a Kanban trainer.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">15. Floor space required reduced by 30%.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">16. Much improved product quality.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">17. Overall stock turnover ratio increased from 7 times to 21 times.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">These figures speak for themselves; in our view, no more persuasion is necessary on behalf of JIT. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Note, that in a similar fashion to the above, </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">flexible, lean, and JIT measures can be, and should be specified for non-manufacturing cells too,</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> including, design offices, for goods received processes, for processes dealing with customer order paperwork, and many others.</font></p>
