					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The CE process does not end with a product, that leaves a factory and then everybody can forget about it... It should incorporate service aspects too, as part of a multi-lifecycle quality system covering concept to remanufacturing, and even recycling; the entire circle, often more than once. </font></p>
				  <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As we all know, many products need maintenance, and after sales support. Good CE engineers, designers and quality control engineering managers MUST think about these processes too at the design stage. This way they can create a truly world-class product.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As an example, many people in the early 1960s in the automobile industry thought that by creating high quality products, customers will not come back and purchase a new model every 3-4 years. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Others created very high quality cars, and th eresult is that these high quality designers and automakers are still around and prospering, whilst others have sunk... The lesson is, that quality CE is the ONLY realistic, long term future in design.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The purpose of this Chapter is to offer analytical thinking, and a systems approach on how to develop and maintain a service quality system, that follows </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">quality standards, and in return assures service</font></p>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Improve, and sustain customer satisfaction. </font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As we have stated earlier, service quality control means establishing and maintaining specified quality standards of services, and service quality engineering is the establishment and execution of tests to measure service quality and adherence to acceptance criteria specified in the standards. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We all have, or had good as well as poor quality service experiences in restaurants, hotels, garages, computer service stores, in schools, universities, at airports, at bus stations, at gas (petrol) stations, and elsewhere. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Let's see what methods there are to improve poor services, and make good ones even better... it is a huge business opportunity!</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Based on the latest ISO interpretation, this section introduces the eight quality management principles on which the quality management, including the quality service system standards are based. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">These principles can be used by senior management as a framework to guide their service organizations towards improved performance. (Note, that the Industrial Internet of Things networking and knowledge management framework offers an amazing opportunity to turn the ideas presented in this chapter into major business results.)</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Read these principles again, with customer service quality in mind...</font></p>

					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Increased revenue and market share can be obtained through flexible and fast responses to market opportunities. (As service examples, consider a web-based airline reservation system, that optimizes time and cost between your needs, and what airlines offer; or a bank, that can approve mortgages, house sales and purchases in record time, because the legal aspects are performed in a JIT fashion, and others.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Increased effectiveness in the use of the organization's resources to enhance customer satisfaction.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Improved customer loyalty leading to repeat business</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Customer needs and expectations are understood better than before. (As a service example, consider that many hotels don't allow children, or dogs. Is there a way around this?)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Organizational objectives become better linked to customer needs and expectations, and </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Customer needs and expectations are better communicated throughout the organization. (Think of a few visual displays in hotels, airports, garages where many questions could be spared by offering clear signs of communication...)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Customer satisfaction, as well as the actions taken on the results become measurable. </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Customer relationships become systematically managed at all levels of the organization.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A balanced approach is ensured between satisfying customers and other interested parties (such as owners, employees, suppliers, financiers, local communities and the society as a whole.)</font>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Activities are evaluated, aligned and implemented in a unified way. (As service examples, consider a hotel, or a garage, where procedures are documented and followed properly...)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Miscommunication between levels of the organisation will be minimized. (Lack of directives, procedures, and processes open up the opportunity for miscommunication...)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The needs of all interested parties can be considered, including customers, owners, employees, suppliers, financiers, local communities, and the society as a whole. (Not easy, but needs good communication, and of course a true, honest cause... like keeping air and water quality clean, and others).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A clear vision of the organization's future can be established. (A good and clear mission statement helps...)</font>
						<li>C<font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">hallenging goals and targets can be set.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Shared values can be created and sustained, and fairness and ethical models can be created at all levels of the organization.</font>

					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Successful organizations need motivated, committed and involved people. (Train by setting good examples. Encourage to employees to seek better solutions. Listen to what they are telling you; they live with their processes every day, they know them better than management...)</font>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Employees should be eager to participate in and contribute to continual improvement. (Respect and award them for good ideas.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Employees should understand the importance of their contribution and their roles in the organization.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Employees should be able to identify the constraints of their performances.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Employees should accept the ownership of problems and it should be their responsibility to solve them</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Employees should evaluate their performances against their personal goals and objectives. (Set levels, but only rarely rank employees, and even then only on the basis of selected in advance, and well understood critical performance items).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Employees should be actively seeking opportunities to enhance their competence, knowledge and experience levels. (Offer them education and training).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Employees should freely share knowledge and experience (within confined circles, as business confidentiality allows).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Employees should openly discuss problems and issues with each other. (Create a trustworthy, positive atmosphere at the workplace for employees to talk to each other during breaks, and meetings).</font>

					<p><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Key Drivers and Achievable Gains Include the Following:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Lower costs and shorter cycle times can be achieved, through effective and controlled use of resources. (Processes must be well documented and understood. CIMpgr is a great concept and tool.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Improved, consistent and predictable results can be offered to both internal, as well as external customers</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Focused and prioritized improvement opportunities become reality, since each process step is identified and controlled (in a similar fashion to an object, with it's identifier, attributes, and behavior, when following object-oriented system modeling principles).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Activities are defined systematically, therefore the desired result can be obtained realistically. (In CIMpgr Inputs, Outputs, Resources and Controls become very obvious and clear to everyone, at every layer of the process pyramid.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Clear responsibility and accountability can be established for managing key activities in literally any organization. (Responsibilities, and authority are typically not defined clearly in most organizations. This leads to finger pointing, lack of motivation, and poor management / workforce communication.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The capability of key activities can be analyzed and measured. (Identify the key activities and processes. Make them visually clear and understandable to everyone. Imagine a multimedia training program for garage technicians, or for janitors, or for nurses, and many others, who must perform critical services.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The interfaces and communication paths of key activities within, and between the functions (or in other words classes of objects) of the organization can be identified. (Affinity diagrams and CIMpgr models can help here a great deal.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">By focusing on factors such as resources, methods, and materials key activities of the organization can be improved.</font>

					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Processes that will achieve the desired results will become better integrated and aligned. (Consider using CIMpgr for process modeling; it is a great communication tool).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Management and process owners will have the ability to focus their efforts on the key processes. (Affinity diagrams can help here a lot).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Since the consistency, effectiveness and the efficiency of the organization will grow, the confidence of interested parties in the organization will grow too.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">System structuring and tuning will become possible to achieve the organization's objectives in the most effective and efficient way.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Understanding the interdependencies between the processes of the system will yield good results. (An integrated approach to process modeling, requirements and risk analysis within a TQM framework works extremely well).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Structured (and object/ component-oriented) modeling approaches that harmonize and integrate processes will become reality.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The resistance created by cross-functional barriers will be reduced, providing a better understanding of the roles and responsibilities necessary for achieving common objectives. (Make everybody a contributing team member, then reward them well).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Organizational capabilities, and the establishment of resource constraints prior to action will be better understood by all involved (and mostly by all those who have created the models).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Targeting and defining how specific activities within a system should operate become reality. (Clear, measurable targets are essential).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Continually improving the system through measurement and evaluation becomes possible, due to the analytical and quantifiable approach of the process models. (CIMpgr can create wonders).</font>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Performance advantage through improved organizational capabilities. (Well documented procedures should be continuously improved, and communication lines should be distributed. New ideas should be encouraged to 'think outside the box'. In most service industries the fatal mistake is that management does not understand the way the typical hotel guest, or airline passenger think, or behaves, just to raise a few examples. They don't know what information and services they need, how they orient themselves, because they have been in the business for too many years, separated from the customers, already forgotten what it is all about... the key here is to find a few new customers who can open managers' eyes and ears and explain them what should be improved by walking through the process steps, step-by-step, analyzing every process, including the process's condition space.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Alignment of improvement activities at all levels to an organization's strategic intent.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Flexibility to react quickly to opportunities. (As a service example, consider the introduction of new materials in a dental office to avoid mercury poisoning.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A consistent organization-wide approach to the continual improvement of the organization's performance. (Change must come from the top, and change management should cover the entire business; assuming it is a change for the better.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Employees should be offered training in the methods and tools of continual improvement. (Short lunch break training sessions are very valuable.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Continual improvement of products, processes and systems should be an objective for every individual in the organization.</font>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Key Drivers and Achievable Gains Include the Following:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There is increased ability to create value for both parties, meaning the employer, as well as the employees.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The flexibility and speed of joint responses to changing market or customer needs and expectations becomes a possibility. (A lean organization, adopting JIT principles can always react to market changes, or disasters better.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Optimization of costs and resources is possible. (By analyzing the resource side of CIMpgr models huge savings can be achieved.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Relationships can be established, that balance short-term gains with long-term considerations. (Affinity Diagrams document such relations well.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Pooling of expertise and resources with partners can be beneficial.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Identifying and selecting key suppliers is possible.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Clear and open communication is required.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Sharing information and future plans becomes a business reality. (Management must implement an 'open door' policy, a friendly and 'ready to listen' atmosphere, and should inform employees of some of the non-confidential future plans. Note, that some employees and managers are not 'angels', in that they join a company for a year, or so, to spy on future development plans, customer service tricks and secrets, and others.)</font>
