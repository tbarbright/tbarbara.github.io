Mission: to provide manufacturing technology educators with the tools and resources they need to be successful. The future of the manufacturing industry depends upon this country&rsquo;s educators and business leaders. The NCME works to provide them with best-of-class and leading-edge products and services to successfully educate tomorrow&rsquo;s manufacturing workers and leaders. Manufacturing Education Resource Center -MERC, is a national clearinghouse of resources for educators and industry professionals with a vast database of print, multimedia and online resources, along with a powerful search engine. Designed to enable users to find and gain access to materials and other resources that can enhance their teaching. Created in 2003 to provide a clearinghouse for manufacturing education resources. Visit the NCME website! http://www.ncmeresource.org/. This is the third of six webinars to be held during the first three years of the project.<br>
