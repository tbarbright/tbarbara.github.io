This is why we are so pleased to offer you the new edition of this web-browser readable interactive multimedia 3D eBook.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Internet is changing our every-day lives. Companies are selling their products directly to well informed customers over the web 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The purpose of this  100 percent intranet / Internet compatible interactive multimedia publication / program is to introduce and review complex quality systems, products and processes to a customer base that is prepared to learn and then take educated decisions. This is why you will find that our interviews and Virtual Product Demos are often in depth and technical.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In terms of the format and ease of use, we introduce Case Based Learning (or Problem Based Learning, or Context Based Learning, for our purposes meaning the same) and Case Based Marketing methods. These methods are very effective to both the learning as well as the marketing communities, since their missions are very similar. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">When you work with this program, imagine that you are looking at Virtual Product Demonstrations at a huge web site, with the benefits of the speed and the quality of the CD-ROM/ DVD-ROM (or your fast intranet, or a server, or the cloud) versus the average Internet.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Notice, that contrary to many other electronic publications, this is a non-linear approach, it is open source, and it feels like an interactive electronic book. It is 100 percent web-enabled, therefore can run off a fast web-server or factory intranet, assuming you have the multi-user license, or the fast Internet connection from our server.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You can jump to pages and topics as you decide, every video is interactive and high quality, you can select a portion of it and play it again and again, you always know how long it takes, you can always stop it and jump to another section, and many other features, such as our optional 3DVR objects and 360 degree virtual tours that we have integrated into this package.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We have developed this simple, high quality and easy-to-use presentation structure based on over 25 years of interactive multimedia R&amp;D, education and professional consulting experiences.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Due to the fact that this topic is full of acronyms and terminology that at first sounds strange to most people, we give a very comprehensive <a href="GlossaryOfTerms.html">Glossary of Terms</a>. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">A suggestion:</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> as you work through the material keep this Glossary file open in a separate window. In terms of terminology, the Glossary often goes further than the main program, or case. Read this often if you have the energy to do so. You'll learn a lot!.</font></p>

				  <p>How This Interactive Multimedia eBook (and the optional eLearning Pack; please email for details to: <a href="mailto:cimware@mac.com">cimware@mac.com</a>)  Helps You To Learn To Innovate&hellip; and Why Innovation is Important&hellip;</p>
				  <p>The world is changing rapidly&hellip; and those of us who don&rsquo;t want to accept change and cannot innovate for the better, will end up as followers&hellip; and will not be in leadership positions in engineering management, project management, engineering product, process or service system design&hellip; including managing hardware, software, as well as workforce developments&hellip; (all tightly integrated and related fields of course&hellip;).</p>
				  <p>This eBook helps you to learn how to innovate. It helps you to understand and learn how to drive some aspects of crucially important innovation, and the positive change processes. (Note, that this is not a commercial. Every statement below is supported by facts. It is trying to clarify the future a bit&hellip; for You.)</p>
				  <p>What is innovation?  Innovation is the action or process of innovating.<br>
				    Synonyms include the following: new thing, new method, change, alteration, revolution, upheaval, transformation, metamorphosis, breakthrough, a new method, a new idea, a new product, process, service, a new system, etc. (Example: &lsquo;technological innovations designed to improve energy efficiency&rsquo;.)</p>
				  <p>Innovation is the process of translating an idea or invention into a product, process or service that creates value. To be called an innovation, an idea must be replicable at an economical cost and must satisfy a specific need. Innovation involves deliberate application of information, imagination and initiative in deriving greater or different values from resources, and includes all processes by which new ideas are generated and converted into useful products.</p>
				  <p>In business, innovation often results when ideas are applied by the company in order to further satisfy the needs and expectations of the customers.</p>
				  <p>In a social context, innovation helps create new methods for alliance creation, joint venturing, flexible work hours, and creation of buyers' purchasing power.</p>
				  <p>In product / process / service systems, innovations are divided into two major categories:</p>
				  <p>1. Evolutionary innovations, that are brought about by many incremental advances in design, system integration, technology or processes (e.g. when an improved, faster and more reliable computer is announced), and</p>
				  <p>2. Revolutionary innovations, which are often disruptive (e.g. when digital HD video replaced analogue video, or when paper-based files were replaced by computerized databases, or when traditional analog phones were replaced by smartphones).</p>
				  <p>Innovation is synonymous with risk-taking and organizations that create revolutionary products or technologies take on the greatest risk because they create new markets. (Ref.: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/innovation.html)</p>
				  <p>Obviously innovation is critically important for every person, company, university, country and our world as a whole. As an example, just think of how global warming affects all of us, and all the innovative methods, tools and technologies that we are deploying worldwide to reduce the effects of global warming.</p>
				  <p>What the Future Looks Like&hellip; and How Should We Prepare to Lead? After this introduction about innovation, let me summarize what is happening in our fast pacing innovation world, and the major trends around the world in the coming years and decades.</p>
				  <p>We are networked and connected 24/7 as a result of modern Internet technology. We have invented ways to connect, and work together, figure out customer requirements, product / process risks, processes, customer and process behaviors and others, that were unthinkable even just 10-15 years ago.</p>
				  <p>We can collect data from online storage in the cloud, from social networks, from Facebook to LinkedIn, and Twitter. We have moved on from expensive long-distance and international phone calls to free Internet-based solutions, like Skype, email, Whatsapp, and many others.</p>
				  <p>We have moved on from single workstations to collaborative design, manufacturing and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)&hellip; and this is now part of everything we do, all the time, 24/7. We work with each other in increasingly more collaborative and distributed ways&hellip; and this trend will go on for a long time because diversity in knowledge and teamwork means 2+2 = 5&hellip;</p>
				  <p>It is also true for how we communicate with customers in general. The voice of the customer (VOC) is more empowered than ever before in every product, process / service system design we can experience / analyze. Yes, customers are more in charge of everything we develop therefore we have to listen carefully, then analyze the results, and then innovate, design and produce accordingly.</p>
				  <p>How can we capture the customer&rsquo;s voice?  There are several solutions&hellip; here is one:  my interactive multimedia eBook has an analytical method as well as several active code tools / spreadsheets on how to capture, feed and integrate customer requirements into the quality design process. We call it CORA, Component Oriented Customer Requirements Analysis with DOE, Ranky-Taguchi Design of Experiments. This is because we break down the customer requirements into components, and objects, following an object-oriented approach. Figuring out what customers want most and how we could achieve customers&rsquo; desires, needs and wants must be everybody&rsquo;s interest since one way or the other we are all designing systems for customers; else we cannot stay in business&hellip;The fact is, that this method works very well in industry.  All major US and international companies use this, or similar method, to capture and analyze customer needs, wants and desires.</p>
				  <p>Customers today share opinions on-line in a matter of seconds, about all products all the time, around the world. As a result of this radical connectedness, hierarchies of communication have flattened the world, reshaped the power relationship between rulers and masses, and even between management, engineers and associates (yes, the world is flat in this sense, and also smaller, due to the networked interconnectedness).</p>
				  <p>These are huge customer-driven forces, that make this change happen (they basically drive demand and innovation to new levels).</p>
				  <p>Also, complexity is increasing. Today&rsquo;s world is more complex and more integrated too.</p>
				  <p>Building products used to be simpler; although innovation was always hard. There were major limitations in the past; and still there are, nevertheless significantly less&hellip; just think of this: hardware products could only handle so many lines of code; web applications only had to worry about a couple of browsers and screen sizes, and there were fewer programing frameworks too.</p>
				  <p>Today, hardware contains a lot more software. This is the way we can innovate faster, customize systems, and make systems smarter too!</p>
				  <p>Software products need to consider many more devices, customer behaviors and conditions, culture and others, and open source has provided the development community with many more libraries, frameworks and languages from which to choose.</p>
				  <p>Object-orientation and reusable code, and objects in the physical domain (a.k.a. modules, in modular designs, invented by Egyptians and other engineers who built pyramids 3800 BC and even earlier!), are extremely important here too. All of this leads to innovation. A greater number of platforms and browsers must be supported. This has introduced a huge amount of complexity, as well as forced many software engineers to innovate.</p>
				  <p>In the mobile world: smartphones are now the norm, with more sold worldwide than traditional feature / desktop phones. We&rsquo;re also adding tablets and wearables (e.g. the Apple Watch) to the array of connected devices. We are connected everywhere in the world with most of our devices (e.g. laptops, desktops, tablets and phones) simultaneously, and we are using these technologies when we work, travel, work out, study, help others in need, eat and dine, fish and ski&hellip; all the time and everywhere; we live with these connected devices 24/7!</p>
				  <p>They help us to find where we are (using maps with GPS), how fast we are traveling on our bikes, what is the weather like anywhere in the world, write music on the top of a mountain, converting temperatures, currencies and distances, and millions of other apps focusing on problem solving in our interconnected world.</p>
				  <p>Mobile devices are now part of every product, process, and service system design&hellip;</p>
				  <p>Just think of one question: Can you imagine a product today without a website, and an electronic user manual that can be accessed anywhere, anytime, by literally anyone? And customer service over the Internet, from anywhere in the world for free (including free Skype-ing, chatting, emails, etc.)? Of course not. And all of this 24/7 around the world.</p>
				  <p>So, if you have to change a faulty part on your sailing boat in Palau you can get it fixed with proper multimedia customer support over the web within minutes, versus weeks or months! Or if as a designer need feedback about your automotive part design quality you can data mine the service records of a very large number of cars due to the IIOT (Industrial Internet of Things) capabilities of your systems.</p>
				  <p>This is why in this eBook is often used in a course as part of an eLearning Pack. In this pack we have four collaborative companies, and also a comprehensive interactive multimedia eBook with text, videos, 360 degree interactive panoramas, active code / spreadsheet tools to compute with your own data, rather than traditional paper-based textbook, or even a typical PDF eTextbook with text and some images&hellip; and this is why in this course you are also asked to conduct social networking exercises based on the up-to-date articles I am sending you; all of this relates and helps you to innovate, collaborate and become a leader in this complex and rapidly changing world. And all of the above helps you to learn about, and experience the beauty and the power of innovation. This is the real value of the eLearning Pack.</p>
				  <p>So, how do I help you in this course to achieve the above goals ? You create and populate your own (virtual) company&rsquo;s website, you invent a product, process or service, you collaborate with the eLearning Pack companies, you conduct your processes, customer requirements analysis, process risk analysis, statistical work, social networking, human error detection / prevention, and others. All of this helps you to learn and experience the magic of innovation! Innovation, that will be rewarded with a dream job!</p>
				  <p>In the social networking world the modern hardware devices we&rsquo;ve started using since early 2000 help us connect to each other through a number of highly adopted global social networks. (Note, some prefer their own, more secure social networking solutions&hellip;) It&rsquo;s easier than ever to share information and opinions across the world instantly. This has major social, political as well as economic impacts. The world&rsquo;s political systems, as an example, have reacted to such system design changes by either enabling, or suppressing such open changes in fear of losing their positions of control&hellip; but change is inevitable at all fronts.</p>
				  <p>As an example, consider this: traditional printed books are being replaced in most universities in the world by interactive multimedia talking books with active code to calculate with&hellip; because they are better; they help to learn faster, more involved, more customized (e.g. you can calculate with your own data), in a collaborative fashion with others, and with more fun too because they help the students to explore and innovate; learning is hard work, it must be more fun&hellip; everybody knows this.</p>
				  <p>New generations, in particular the millennial generation wants change and wants to create new designs and systems that fit their need&hellip; change is inevitable even in suppressed societies&hellip; in open, progressive societies change is welcome and celebrated because it helps to make life (in most cases) better quality!</p>
				  <p>In the corporate world of enterprises, as an example, Google is one of the global leaders and is shifting from just software towards more complex product systems, such as self-driving cars, Google Glass, robotics and smart home systems. Amazon has released Kindles, Fire-streaming entertainment devices and mobile phones. Apple has become the most valuable company in the world and many companies see Apple as the source of innovation light&hellip; this is mainly because Apple always focused on customer-centered innovation, hardware, and software, in integration. Many companies copy whatever Apple develops as fast as they can, or cannot&hellip; In response, in most cases, Apple responds by innovating faster and better&hellip; and integrating their systems better and better&hellip; and setting better and better sustainable green engineering standards too. This is good change and positive customer focused innovation.</p>
				  <p>We can now communicate across teams in many ways that were unavailable 10-15 years ago, enabling modern, distributed teams to work together more efficiently. However, the growth in distributed teams also amplifies the organizational, as well as IP (Intellectual Property) theft challenges of product development and delivery. It also raises the bar on cybersecurity.</p>
				  <p>It should be noted, that if done right, the data collected from failure can be valuable and actionable feedback. Product, process and service system development management is not only about defining what needs to be built but also about designing customer and stakeholder expectations. By defining outcomes and managing expectations with the rest of the organization, you&rsquo;ll be better able to utilize the data obtained from product failures.</p>
				  <p>In my multimedia eBooks we have a great quality method and tool, called PFRA, Process Failure Risk Analysis. This is an extended version of an ISO, International Standards Organization method and tool, called FMEA, Failure Mode Effects Analysis. It helps to identify risky processes and keep them under control. This reduces, and often avoids failure entirely! It is also an excellent source for risk-focused product, process system innovation. (Interesting fact: in 2015, ISO, the International Standards Organization has changed the focus of the well known ISO 9001:2015 quality standard and is now emphasizing risk management. I have introduced at least some level risk management in virtually all eBooks and all courses I have taught since 1995&hellip; and that is 20 years earlier than ISO 9001:2015&hellip;)</p>
				  <p>Success is theoretically about getting it right. Agile and the idea of working product development, including working software development, is about putting it out there for feedback, which means you are not always going to be right.</p>
				  <p>What&rsquo;s key here is to test and validate your designs first, so that you make it as best as possible, and then be prepared to react to the feedback so you can act quickly and continually. This builds loyalty and admiration in a world where customers are highly engaged and demand interaction. (Apple products are good examples. They are far from perfect, nevertheless Apple listens to customers&rsquo; feedback and tries to continuously improve&hellip;)</p>
				  <p>In practical terms, the above means the following:</p>
				  <p>&bull; Data (big data!) and science, statistical evidence will drive decisions in the future, and therefore your decisions should be improving too (to achieve this, in this eBook our method and tools include process modeling, and statistical analysis, control charts for variables and attributes, and other lean six-sigma quality tools, amongst others)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Human culture and the way different cultures react to product innovation will be the new focus, and therefore your customers will increasingly enjoy your products (to achieve this, in this eBook our method and tools include process modeling, social networking, video-based education to explore different cultures, collaborative company analysis, amongst others)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Individual behavior will be a driver and your customization procedures will consider individual customer behavior (to achieve this, in this course our method and tools include CORA, process modeling, and stat. analysis, amongst others)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Tools will play a larger role; just look at the millions of apps available now, following object-oriented development principles and very easy to use user interfaces. (The eBook is built of web-browser compatible objects and the tools are typically either web-based or MS-Excel-based, that are easy to use. Also, the videos in the optional eLearning Pack, and also in the eBook(s) help you to understand why and how to use these tools. This is very important. It is not enough to be able to use the tools, but also to use them well for the purpose they have been designed for&hellip;)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Finding ways to constantly provide visibility to the organization will be ever so important. (This is why knowledge management over the web, using your own web pages are very helpful here.)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Allowing communication and opinions to flow freely will be crucial to enable innovation. (Note: in companies and societies in which dissenting opinions are suppressed, innovation suffers greatly!)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Constantly asking if people understand not only what they are doing but also why. (Interaction, communication in live as well as in my eLearning classes is established by emails, video-conferencing over the web, discussing each others&rsquo; web pages, as well as discussing the up-to-date, topic-related social media discussion articles I post for every student in the class. In the live class we have several small group exercises and team presentations during the semester.)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Opening dialogue about culture. (My eBooks are technical, nevertheless we spend time on cultural aspects by reviewing several full length videos, shot in various parts of the world. We also refer to cultural aspects when we discuss quality design, requirements, expectations, audit, out-of-control situations in quality, and others. We use many tools and electronic templates for this.)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Embracing a quality process focus at every level. (We have many tools for this and our process modeling methods, tools and templates are ISO compatible. We also use many lean six-sigma quality tools, amongst others.)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Starting with too much information of a dream system, then working your way back to find the balance and a realistic system design</p>
				  <p>&bull; Creative, imaginative, innovative new products. (Note, that every student who completes the assignments in my eBook and eLearning Pack-based classes ends up with a creative, imaginative, innovative new product, process, or service, that he or she has created as part of the coursework. This is documented in the open Internet, in a web site, created and maintained by the student, allowing him / her to promote his / her work to a potential employer. This really works well!)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Machine intelligent, smart devices and add-ons will effect our future greatly. While we do not create such devices physically in the class, individual student-designed projects often have such elements in their project work. (Note, that there are over 25,000 student created assignments on the web, that my students have created in the past.)</p>
				  <p>&bull; Brand loyalty because products change all the time. We are not commercial in this class, nevertheless students take pride in their web sites and promote their own brands. By doing so they understand the importance of brand loyalty.</p>
				  <p>&bull; Intellectual property is the most valuable attribute, commodity in our time. This is because innovating is hard, stealing and illegally copying is often easier&hellip; Some researchers and engineers, artists spend years on innovating, creating a working prototype, a piece of art&hellip; IP, and IP protection is therefore one of the most important and challenging aspects of our interconnected world.</p>
				  <p>&bull; Energy prices dropping due to efficiency increases. Alternative energy sources are becoming viable (e.g. solar is now 42% efficient, vs. 8-10% as it was in 2000!) In all of my courses and eBooks there is a sustainable green engineering focus. All students understand the importance of this.<br>
			      </p>
				  <p>To summarize, the world looks very different today than it did in 2000, nevertheless the above principles will last for many years because they promote innovation and progress with a positive, quality focus. Just consider this for the future: if we could resolve food, energy, health and education for the rest of the world, over a billion new minds could contribute to innovation! &hellip; and this is not an impossible task at all. We could do it! Let&rsquo;s do it and change the world one-by-one&hellip; together.<br>
