		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"><b>Acknowledgment </b>In data transmission, after transmitting a data block the transmitting terminal sends a check character, (ACK, or acknowledgment character) based on the contents of the data block. The receiving terminal (or computer) compares this character with its own computation of the check character.<br>
				<br>
				If they are the same then no transmission error has occurred and the receiving terminal sends the control character ACK to the transmitter to signify that the communication was error free.<br>
				<br>
				If the check characters differ, then an error has occurred and the receiver sends a NAK (negative acknowledgment) character to indicate an error to the transmitter. The transmitter then repeats transmission of the same block and the process repeats.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Acoustic Coupler </b>A device that converts electrical signals into audio signals, and vice-versa.<br>

				sending device (or user for the purpose of sending electronic mail to him, and for other services) and the<br>
				receiving device (or user).<br>
				<br>
				A typical Internet address has the following format:<br>
				<br>
				yourusername@hostname<br>
				<br>
				where username is your user name, or login code, or Internet account number, and hostname is the Internet name for the Internet provider.<br>
				<br>
				As an example, CIMware&rsquo;s Internet Email (electronic mail) address on the Internet is: cimware@cimwareukandusa.com<br>
				<br>
				This indicates, that it is a company web site in the USA, accessible world-wide on the net. (Note, that for USA based web accounts there is no country code, e.g. .uk, because the Internet was originally developed in the USA)<br>
				<br>

		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"><b>Backbone network </b>A typically high-speed central network, that connects a number of typically slower networks into a system for the purpose of linking networks together with a high-speed communications facility.<br>
				<br>
				Sub-networks branch off the backbone network.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Backbone router </b>A type of router, that connects compatible networks together through a backbone network, so that networks can be linked in a non-serial manner.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Background Tasks </b>Functions performed by the computer while allowing the computer to be used for other activities.<br>
				<br>
				Background functions are not always apparent to the user.<br>

				<b>Bandwidth, or Data Transfer Rate </b>The range of signal frequencies (or transmission frequencies) which can be carried by a transmission channel subject to specified conditions of signal loss or distortion.<br>
				<br>
				As an example, consider the following: a<br>
				<br>
				A relatively slow Internet communication using a 28.8 modem offers 3.6 kilo bytes per second data transfer rate.<br>
				<br>
				An ISDN connection (Integrated Digital Services Network, on dual lines) offers much more, 16 kilo bytes per seconds (= 2x64 kilo bits per seconds).<br>
				<br>
				Furthermore, consider the fact that a relatively slow (i.e. 2x, or dual-speed) CD-ROM drive gives 300 kilo bytes per seconds transfer rate (=2x150) and a more reasonable CD-ROM, 4x gives 600 kilo bytes per seconds, meaning 166.66 times faster than the 28.8 modem linked Internet!<br>
				<br>
				In comparison a so called T1 line has a bandwidth of 1.544 Mbps (Megabits per second).<br>
				<br>
				Note, that the above analysis of transfer rates is of extreme importance, when delivering high quality, storage intensive interactive multimedia in particular.<br>

				<b>bit</b> The smallest computer data unit. A bit can have a value of 1 (one), or 0 (zero).<br>
				<br>
				Combinations of bits build up strings of bits. One of the most commonly known string of bits is the byte, occupying 8 bits (e.g. 10101011).<br>
				<br>
				One of the most fascinating thing about digital computers is that at the heart of the machine everything is represented by strings of zeros and ones, even color photos, and moving images!<br>
				<br>
				<b>BITFTP</b> A widely available FTP-by-mail server.<br>
				<br>
				FTP, or File Transfer Protocol means copying one or more files (a group of data) between computers according to set rules. (Note that the rules are set by the protocol).<br>

				<br>
				<b>Broadband</b> A computer network, that can transmit many signals simultaneously.<br>
				<br>
				A broadband communications channel can accommodate broadcast and other services on it.<br>
				<br>
				As an example, consider a broadband network, that uses one channel for digital video, another one for data, another one for voice messaging, etc. - all simultaneously.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Broadband ISDN, or B-ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) with ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), - meaning NOT Automatic Teller Machine (!) </b>There are several different, multiple computer and communications (e.g. voice, video) networks in operation. Some of which are controlled by telephone companies, some not.<br>
				<br>
				Maintaining several different networks and services is a major problem, thus the solution is to develop Broadband ISDN, or B-ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) with ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) technology, meaning that the communication is not synchronous, in other words it is not tied to a master clock.<br>
				<br>
				The B-ISDN technology offers on-line live television, video on demand, full screen interactive multimedia and electronic mail, CD quality voice/ sound and music, and fast LAN connections (1 Gbps, one Giga bits per second) for computer networking. The cost is huge!<br>

				<br>
				A signal route to which several items of a computer system may be connected in parallel so that signals can be passed between them.<br>
				<br>
				A bus is also called a trunk in the USA, and a highway in the UK.<br>
				<br>
				<b>byte</b> Usually a group of 8 bits (e.g. 10010011)<br>
				<br>

				When a station wishes to send a message it first waits until no other station is transmitting.<br>
				<br>
				When two or more stations try to send messages concurrently, collisions may occur since a station will not see another station's signal until after it has begun its own transmission.<br>
				<br>
				A collision detection (CD) mechanism detects the collision, causing the stations to terminate their current transmissions and try again later (hence CSMA/CD).<br>

				<b>Data transfer rate, or bandwidth </b>The range of signal frequencies (or transmission frequencies) which can be carried by a transmission channel subject to specified conditions of signal loss or distortion. As an example, consider the following:<br>
				<br>
				A relatively slow Internet communication using a 28.8 modem offers 3.6 kilo bytes per second data transfer rate. An ISDN connection (Integrated Digital Services Network, on dual lines) offers much more, 16 kilo bytes per seconds (= 2x64 kilo bits per seconds).<br>
				<br>
				Furthermore, consider the fact that a relatively slow (i.e. 2x, or dual-speed) CD-ROM drive gives 300 kilo bytes per seconds transfer rate (=2x150) and a more reasonable CD-ROM, 4x gives 600 kilo bytes per seconds, meaning 166.66 times faster than the 28.8 modem linked Internet!<br>
				<br>
				Note, that the above analysis of transfer rates is of extreme importance, when delivering high quality, storage intensive interactive multimedia with thousands of colors of digital photos and videos with sound!<br>
				<br>
				Methods, such as data compression, data streaming, progressive decompression, etc. help to reduce the need for high bandwidth, for gaining time (or speed), but nevertheless at the price of the quality of the video and photo images used in the presentation.<br>

				<br>
				It defines the Physical and Data Link layers and the interface to higher layers.<br>
				<br>
				It is a 10Mbit/sec (or 10Mbps) baseband system, using CSMA/CD access control and provides a datagram packet delivery service.<br>
				<br>
				CSMA/CD stands for Carrier-Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection.<br>
				<br>
				A data link control protocol for networks in which all stations (terminals, or computers) can receive all messages.<br>
				<br>
				When two or more stations try to send messages concurrently, collisions may occur since a station will not see another station's signal until after it has begun its own transmission.<br>
				<br>
				A collision detection (CD) mechanism detects the collision, causing the stations to terminate their current transmissions and try again later (hence CSMA/CD).<br>

				Note, that when fiber - optic cabling systems are linked to electronic computers, the electronic signals are converted to light signals, sent over to the receiving device over the fiber - optic cable, and then converted back to electronic signals.<br>
				<br>
				This technique allows 100Mbps (or 100 Mbits/sec) signal transmission speeds or faster, depending on how many parallel fiber cables are there in a cabling system, and the associated hardware and software to manage the data.<br>

				<b>Frame relay</b> In the 1970s, at the time ARPANET - the father of all computer networks - was born, telephone lines were analogue, slow and unreliable.<br>
				<br>
				At the same time, computers were slow, unreliable and expensive. In such environments in order to protect a communication, complex protocols were developed to mask errors.<br>
				<br>
				As a consequence, complex protocols made the communication slow.<br>
				<br>
				In contrast, today telephone lines are digital, fast and reliable. Computers are fast, reliable and inexpensive. There is less need for complex protocols, but for more speed.<br>

IIoT encompasses every industrial and commercial device that uses the Internet Protocol (IP), generating data on the same network. We are heading into an increasingly real-time, sensory-feedback-controlled, instrumented and networked world, in which machine and human intelligence is widely distributed at every level of an enterprise, including its global supply chains. </span><span id="bnbnbn">Machines in an IIoT system can be literally anything. Examples include: sensors on cars talking to IIoT data centers that can communicate to mobile phones to optimize routes, or energy management aspects of the automobile, or collision avoidance, or a robotic machining cell, to blood pressure monitors, to smart machines that package medication at zero-defect levels in a pharmaceutical company. With the IIoT we are also facing the communication and data analysis / control / data security challenges of billions of things communicating with each other. The good news though, is that the Industrial Internet makes industries become leaner, more effective and efficient, higher quality and more profitable. This is because these new ecosystems of connected smart machines have the potential to increase efficiency, minimize waste, and make people operating them think and act smarter. The Industrial Internet is changing the way we work and we have to prepare for this by designing and implementing these systems, as well as directing and enjoying the benefits of this major transition. The IIoT is an estimated 15 trillion dollar engineering business opportunity and Concurrent / Simultaneous Engineering with Sustainable green PLM and lean six-sigma quality management are essential parts of it. </span></p>

				<b>Mail server</b> One of the relatively more powerful, designated computers on the Internet, that provide mail services.<br>
				<br>
				A mail server usually sends out your mail messages to one or more computers, using a system called SMTP and downloads messages to your machine, using a protocol, called POP.<br>
				<br>
				SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, representing a system and a protocol, by which the Internet delivers mail messages to individual computers, or addressees.<br>
				<br>
				POP stands for Post Office Protocol. This is a system and a protocol for letting mail servers download mail messages to individual computers, or in other words addressees - in a similar way the postmen do this job in the traditional postal service system.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Mailing list </b>A special electronic mail address, that forwards any incoming mail to a list of subscribers of the mailing list.<br>

				<b>Simple protocol</b> In the 1970s, at the time ARPANET - the father of all computer networks - was born, telephone lines were analogue, slow and unreliable.<br>
				<br>
				At the same time, computers were slow, unreliable and expensive. In such environments in order to protect a communication, complex protocols were developed to mask errors.<br>
				<br>
				As a consequence, complex protocols made the communication slow.<br>

				In contrast, today telephone lines are digital, fast and reliable. Computers are fast, reliable and inexpensive. There is less need for complex protocols, but for more speed.<br>
				<br>
				Frame-relay is a service in this environment, designed for users who want a minimum connection-oriented networking service at a reasonable speed and low cost (hence the simple protocol stack).<br>
