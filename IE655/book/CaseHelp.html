					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This interactive, electronic publication wasn't designed to be printed onto static paper, nevertheless you can print it directly from your browser. Let us suggest to test a page or two before printing it. You might want to change the orientation of the printed page to &quot;landscape&quot;, as well as reduce the size to 80-90 percent, or so to make sure that it fits well. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Please keep in mind that despite the fact that the images are stored in high quality, this program was designed to &quot;look good&quot; on your screen. This means that the print quality will vary depending on your printer, as well as browser settings.</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We strongly recommend that you use the latest browser. (Note: several different browsers are available free from the Internet). </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Again, try to use the latest browser.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> This program will run on all browsers available at the time of writing in the USA.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>a_StartCase.html</b> is the main contents, or &quot;home&quot; html file for this program. In other words this is the file everything is object linked to. So it is important that you open this file from the browser first, nevertheless you can open the program from any .html file in the CD directory. You'll eventually get to this main title file (unless you open a media file, or similar that is linked via the &quot;Back&quot; button in the browser).</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This is how to open </font><font color="#8b4513" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">a_StartCase.html</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> from Netscape running on a PC. (Note that the IE (Internet Explorer) sequence is very similar with minor terminology differences. The same applies to Mac users, although it is even simpler on Apple Macs).</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Step 0.</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> Make sure that you have this CD-ROM, or DVD-ROM in your CD / DVD drive! (Trust us, there are some customers, NOT you, who expect to run this program without the CD / DVD in the drive...there are always some challenges for all of us...)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Step 1.</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> Execute the browser the usual way (double click on it). If you are on-line the Internet, the browser will run without any complaints. If you are off-line the Internet your browser will complain about not having been able to establish a network pipe (or connection). Accept this and click on OK.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Step 2.</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b> </b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In the File menu, select 'Open Page', then 'Choose File', and having opened the 'Resources' folder (or directory), select '<b>a_StartCase.html</b>' in the appropriate CD / DVD drive ('look in') in your machine. (Files are sorted in most cases in an alphabetic order). Note, that some PCs won't show the .html extension after 'a_StartCase'. This is fine; no problem, it is the same file.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Step 3.</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b> </b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Then double click on '<b>a_StartCase.html</b>' and click on 'Open' (in navigator mode). This will open the a_StarCase file, the home and the title file of this program. Once you see our opening screen, just click on 'Contents' to start the show...or in other words, to 'open this electronic book'.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Enjoy and explore. There are several Internet links in this program which you can execute only if you are on-line, nevertheless the rest of the program behaves exactly the same way wether or not you are on-line or off-line. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If you are off-line and click on an on-line Internet link you'll get a simple error message from the browser that will not cause any harm.</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This is a very robust, high quality and well established cross platform format. If you have difficulties playing the videos please make sure that you have at least QuickTime version 4.0 or later installed on your machine, and that you can access it through your browser. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">QuickTime is very user friendly and if you install it as &quot;full&quot; it will automatically integrate itself into your browser so that when you click on a movie icon in this program it will automatically start to play in most browsers. (You can also open these files in a separate browser window. This way you can position the media files wherever you want them on your screen. Note again, that this behavior will vary depending on your browser).</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Please feel free to explore the interactive start/ stop, frame-by-frame, etc. features of QuickTime. It is a great program!</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Also note that the same QuickTime ver. 4.0 or later program executes the interactive 3DVR as well as the panoramic images. This means that if you have installed it properly it will do all media jobs for you! (It will even be able to open your .jpg image files). </font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Many of our 3DVR objects are animated within the videos. This means that there are several layers of animations stitched together into an interactive 3D experience. (very tricky but works well...) </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You can activate this feature by clicking onto the movie's poster frame and then moving the mouse up and down whilst pressing the mouse button down. (If there is no change, it means that that particular 3DVR object is not animated... sorry... sometimes we have to sleep too...)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If you move the mouse left and right, and up and down you should experience the 3D interactivity of this fascinating technology. There are other features too, such as zoom in and out. The quality will depend on your machine, as well as on your screen. Note, that if you zoom in too far the image will pixelate gradually. This is because this program was designed for the 'typical' user with a 'typical' computer in mind. Please keep this in mind.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Note that some of the 3DVR objects are hyper-linked with other 3DVR objects as well as with static images. Have fun finding and exploring them. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Note that some of the 3DVR objects in this program might be visually large, therefore you should view them in 1024 x 768 pixel or higher resolution to see the full image on the screen. If you cannot set your PC to comply with this resolution and therefore don't see the full 3DVR image, this is not a major problem because by clicking on it and moving the mouse left and right it will still work well.</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Please make sure that you mention that the clip needs a digital video player, such as Apple's QuickTime that can be freely downloaded from the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download</a> website. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If you include the above line exactly by copy-pasting it into your email message the direct link to the apple.com site will be enabled, so the partner can download the driver and view the clip quickly. Note, that other media players will most likely be able to play these video-clips too, nevertheless the QuickTime solution will be without any doubt the best quality! (Try it if you don't believe us...at the time of writing over 950 million users (!) have downloaded this excellent piece of multi-platform, streamed multimedia code).</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Obviously 'slow' can mean different speeds, nevertheless if you have a relatively old machine, such as an 'oldish' 300 MHz PC or PowerMac you will still be able to enjoy the show, but your videos might be slow, the images might look grainy and the 3DVR objects might be a bit jerky. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It is important to recognize that despite what the great public believes, and some salesmen tell you, the CPU clock speed is not the only important parameter of your machine. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The CD drive speed (typically between 12x and 24x, or even faster, meaning 12 x 150 kb/sec to 24 x 150 kb/sec transfer rates), your bus clock speed, your hard disk access time and transfer rates and the way your computer is integrated are very important parameters too. This is why you can experience significantly different overall performance in different PCs even if the clock speed is the same. (Not only that, but the specified CD drive speeds, e.g. 24x mean peak performance speeds, NOT average speeds...interesting marketing... agreed?)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Besides all this, there are major architectural design issues that effect the computer's 'speed'.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As a consequence of all this, at the user end, if you don't see a 3DVR object or one of the longer videos loading this is most likely because you are low on memory.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This program will run on as low as 32 Mbytes, with the operating system and the browser together (!) nevertheless the more memory you have and the more video RAM you have the faster you will fly... (As they say in this business 'the bigger and faster, the better...')</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Also note, that your CD-ROM / DVD-ROM might go to sleep, then wake up and eventually run, or just spin slowly (at 8x or so). There is not much we or you can do about it. If this is the case you might want to consider replacing your drive or even your machine soon. </font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><a name="Anchor-Is-49575"></a></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#8b4513"><b>Is it normal that the screen layout of the program looks a little bit different on different computers?</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Yes! This is due to the fact that we have allowed maximum flexibility in terms of selecting our font types and sizes, as well as because the actual layout you see on your screen depends on the screen resolution and color setting of your computer, as well as the way you have configured your browser. Many components... we know! Imagine, there are millions of computers out there, all configured in a different way... running under different browsers at different speeds, etc. But this is freedom. So it is OK. We support open source, therefore you can change, adjust and even edit and modify...</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If you are unhappy with what you see, change (if possible) the resolution of your screen to at least above 800 x 600, around 1024 x 768 (or whatever best is offered; different on CRT and LCD screens), the number of colors to 32 bit (millions of colors), but at least 16 bit, and the browser font type to Arial 12 or Helvetica 12. This will give you the best possible view and layout design.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Note that some of the 3DVR objects in this program might be visually large, therefore you should view them in 1024 x 768 pixel or higher resolution to see the full image on the screen. If you cannot set your PC to comply with this relatively high resolution and therefore don't see the full 3DVR image, this is not a major problem because by clicking on it and moving the mouse left and right it will still work well.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If you want to fly, use a reasonable machine, preferably around 1GHz, considered 'reasonable' at the time of writing, nevertheless as we have stated earlier, you'll be able to run our programs well around 300-500 MHz too... </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Again: in the IT industry it is true, that the &quot;faster and larger the better&quot;.... Have fun!</font></p>
