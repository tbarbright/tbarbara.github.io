					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The purpose of this chapter is to explain how </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Design for Manufacturing (DFM), Assembly (DFA), Quality (DFQ), and </font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">design for other objective functions (DFx), embedded into</font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> Deming's 14 Points</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> of Management Rules and Quality Concepts, help our concurrent engineering / PLM mission. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It is important to realize, that DFM, and DFA, and DFQ, etc. are not the only methods and tools available to the CE / PLM team, nevertheless they are very important, since they offer opportunities to simplify product designs, reduce the number of parts, eliminate assembly errors, and many other wasteful operations and opportunities.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">First, let us introduce Deming's rules, then turn our attention towards DFM, DFA, DFQ, and DFx / PLM in general.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="maroon"><b>Deming's 14 Rules of Management and Quality Concepts, and How These Rules Effect Our Concurrent Engineering Mission<a name="Anchor-37516" id="Anchor-37516"></a></b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">According to one of Dr. W. Edward Deming's students: &quot;He is the man who taught the Japanese how to produce goods of </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">high quality at low cost. </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">He has introduced the concept that</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> higher quality means lower cost, </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">an idea foreign to most managers&quot;. Since it is well known, that design, manufacturing/assembly and service integration quality made Japanese products and services truly outstanding, this is an important comment in our concurrent engineering discussions.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">In order to understand how Deming has helped design for quality manufacturing, assembly, service and other objective functions, first we explain, that following the </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>classical school</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">, the idea of a good manager is the one who:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Sets up a system, such as a product design system,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Directs the work through subordinates,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Sets a standard of performance</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> for his employees by making </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">crisp and unambiguous assignments. </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Sets goals and production targets,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Rates people</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> as objectively as he / she can. </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Identifies poor performers</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> and either educates them or replaces them. By doing so he / she believes that he /she c</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">reates the </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">most efficient system possible.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Deming's way is different</b> in the sense, that he believes that the purpose of the organization is not to make profit for survival, but to </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">provide the best service or goods at the lowest cost. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">He believes that not only the manager but </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">everyone must contribute</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> to improve the system. After all, the machine operator knows his machine best, the truck driver his routes of delivery, and the maintenance technicians many products.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">In short, Deming's method means that the manager will have a natural basis for building a team and will not have introduced adversarial relations. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Deming's way is not just attention to quality control. It is also</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> a management philosophy for achieving lower cost and higher quality.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">As Deming puts it: </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">'There will be no room for managers who do not know how to work with their people to produce high quality goods at low cost. High reliability cannot be secured without worker co-operation. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Complex systems cannot be understood without statistics. In the competitive world of the future, companies which have not mastered these ideas will simply disappear, and there will be no excuses'.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">To summarize, Deming's fourteen paraphrased rules of management are as follows:</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>1.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> Create consistency and continuity</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> of purpose towards the improvement of products and services with the aim of becoming competitive, staying competitive, and providing jobs. (In terms of CE/PLM, think of the design process of product families. Think of using parametric design methods, well tested modules, components from reliable suppliers, and object oriented thinking throughout th eentire design system.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>2. </b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Refuse to allow commonly accepted levels of <a href="MediaResources/AutoFactoryWIP_Stage.jpg">delay</a> for mistakes</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">, defective material, or defective workmanship. Adopt the new philosophy. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">Accept that we are in a new economic age. Act accordingly otherwise you'll disappear ! </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">Western management must awaken to the challenge, must learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for change. (In terms of CE/PLM, think of well tested supply chains and the importance of early vendor collaboration.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>3. </b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Eliminate the need for, and dependence upon <a href="MediaResources/BMW_CMM_CircMeasure.mov">inspection</a></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> to achieve quality by building quality into the product in the first place. Design for quality, manufacturability, assembly, maintenance, etc. Design quality into the product, process and/or service. (In terms of CE/PLM, think of team-oriented problem solving; teams, that have customers, suppliers, quality, marketing, manufacturing, assembly, etc. functions represented. Let them get involved with th edesign at an early stage.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>4.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> Reduce the number of suppliers and end the practice of awarding business on the basis of the price tag.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">Buy on statistical evidence, not price. Instead minimize the total cost, including the analysis of quality. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">Move towards a single, or few suppliers, and develop a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust. (In terms of CE/PLM, think of supply chains that you can trust.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>5.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> Search continually for problems in the system and seek ways to improve it in order to decrease cost. </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease cost. (In terms of CE/PLM, think of continuous quality improvement opportunities; this should include human performance evaluations and tuition support for further development. Human capital is the most important capital any company has.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>6.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> Institute modern methods of training and education on the job. </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">(In terms of CE/PLM, think of including the big picture into training courses, so that everybody understands at least the basics of the company's mission, the way designers try to work with everyone to create good products, and others.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>7.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> Focus on leadership and supervision to help people to do a better job.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> Provide the tools and techniques for people to have pride in their workmanship. Create an appropriate infrastructure to enable people to concentrate on their jobs. (In terms of CE/PLM, think of proper CAD/CAM systems, simulation tools, and others that help the CE/PLM team to reduce waste and costly changes.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>8.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> Eliminate fear.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> Encourage open, honest, constructive communication between the workforce, the management, the designers, and everybody who plays a key role in the success of the enterprise. Make sure, that everyone may work effectively for the company.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>9.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> Break down barriers between departments.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> Encourage problem solving through teamwork, and prompt information exchange between research, design, sales, and production to foresee problems and solve them effectively. (In terms of CE/PLM, think of organizing group meetings between designers and manufacturing, assembly, quality, maintenance engineers and technicians, so that they exchange ideas, and discuss challenges. Make sure, that people know each other and trust each other too.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>10.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> Eliminate the use of numerical goals, slogans and posters</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> for the workforce. They soon become absurd and meaningless. (Use funny cartoons instead if you are keen on posters !) Note, that design quality and innovation cannot be measured by numbers easily... there is a lot more too it, than fighting for numbers...</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>11.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> Eliminate work standards and quotas on the factory floor. Substitute leadership. Eliminate management by numbers and numerical goals.

The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality. (In terms of CE/PLM, let people talk freely and discuss issues as they occur.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b" size="4"><b>13.</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"> Institute a vigorous program of regular education</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black"> and re-training to keep people abreast of new developments in various areas of science and technology. (In terms of CE/PLM, think of setting up regular design assessment meeting, during which, as an example, maintenance technicians could suggest design changes; a huge opportunity in most companies.)</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black">Explain and teach in a balanced way the broad issues, the corporate culture as well as the technical details, as appropriate to various levels of the workforce.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The sustainable green concept also emphasizes, that the creation of wealth within the community considers the wellbeing of both the human as well as natural environments, and is focused on the more complex processes of development rather than on simple growth or accumulation only. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Advanced, sustainable green design and manufacturing activities are used in many areas, including product and process design, control, fabrication, quality assurance, quality control, test, assembly, disassembly, remanufacturing / recycling, and others.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The prime concern in advanced, or flexible, robotized assembly is to provide unobstructed vertical access for all parts and sub-assemblies. This can be achieved by avoiding lifting and rotating the assembly by following the </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">layered, vertical access, or stacked assembly</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> principles.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Following this concept, typically the largest and most rigid and stable component serves as the </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">assembly base</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, so it is placed first into the fixture, or it acts as a fixture itself, followed by subassemblies and parts layer after layer.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Parts handling, feeding and orientation</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">There are many different aspects that should be considered in this group, including the following:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Are the parts flexible or rigid?</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">&nbsp; Flexible parts, such as cables, wires, belts are more difficult to handle and assemble than rigid parts because the position and orientation of the part varies during handling. As a general rule, all parts that are to be assembled by means of a robot should be rigid and stiff. Furthermore, orientation of the part should be maintained from the point of manufacture to the point of final assembly if at all possible. Think of the following example: a switch doesn't need to be wired to the board, it could be mounted on the board itself with continuity circuitry to provide the electrical connections. If the cable cannot be avoided for some reason, the plug, or cable end must be in a known position (in robotic terms: &quot;location&quot;) and orientation for the robot or assembly head to pick it up. Belts should be replaced by direct drive shafts or gears if possible. Parts can be linked together and kept in a known orientation by means of a shaped plastic tray, or part of a web, or tube, or some other device, like a magazine.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Small parts feeding.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> The most common method employs vibratory bowl feeders, elevating feeders, barrel feeders, parts magazines, strips, etc. (Figure 5.9) These devices can ensure small part feeding as well as orienting. Since the bowl vibrates, it causes small parts to slide and tumble along a specially designed track that spirals upward inside the wall of the bowl. Meanwhile the parts are randomly selected and gradually oriented. They are eventually knocked off the track by a narrow, shaped section of the track, or by strike-off plates, compressed air, or some other method. The parts are then presented in a known position and orientation to the robot, or the gripper of the assembly head. Independently of which feeder is used, tangling, jamming and shingling can be eliminated. If springs are fed, closed-loop springs with a wire diameter greater than the spacing between coils should be used. As a set of general rules, consider the following: sharp edges should be avoided to prevent parts of catching each other or the slides they have to pass through. Tangling can be avoided by part design. To increase the stability of the part, it should have the lowest centre of gravity. The bases of the parts should be flat, preventing them from riding on each other and the mating surfaces of the parts should be as large as possible and perpendicular to the direction of travel.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Parts designed specifically for robotized or automated grasping</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> should be compatible with the kind of gripper jaws used. Typically they should incorporate the appropriate slots, tabs or holes to aid grasping. Parts with relatively large and flat top surfaces are ideal for vacuum or magnetic pickup.</font>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The more symmetrical the part, the easier it is to handle, position and orient. Furthermore, symmetrical parts increase assembly reliability and quality, in particular if the processes are automated, because they reduce the possibility of mating parts in the wrong orientation. If symmetry is not possible, the designer should overemphasise asymmetry by incorporating a holdable flat or shaped surface, a slot or a hole, a pin or a chamfer.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Ease of part positioning, mating and compliance</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Part surfaces brought together during an assembly process can be divided into two different groups, these are:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">1. Surfaces that mate</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, hence are critical and have a function, e.g. support another functional surface, transfer torque, or force, etc., and</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">2. Surfaces that do not mate</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, i.e. are not important from a functional point of view, in other words are &quot;free surfaces&quot;, but still cause concern for reasons of product aesthetics or safety.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When designing for ease of part mating (i.e. bringing parts together in an assembly process) the Concurrent Engineering team must concentrate on simplifying components and their functional surfaces without compromising their functional behaviour or the required aesthetic appearance of the product.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Compliance</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Compliance in Design for Assembly (DFA) means accommodating uncertainty of dimensional tolerances. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Since every mechanical component is manufactured within a given tolerance, defined by design and the machinery used to manufacture it, parts and robot grippers or other tools can jam. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Part misalignment and tolerance stack up occurs when components are produced by different methods, (for example turning, stamping, casting and injection moulding, etc.) and when the designers are not familiar with the quality of machinery the manufacturing engineers work with. Hence compliance must be designed into the product as well as the production processes.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">One of the best ways of avoiding jamming and other types of compliance problems is to design compliance, (e.g. generous chamfers on both mating parts so that the parts fit together even when slightly misaligned). </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">This can be achieved by chamfers and various shapes of lead-ins.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Fasteners </b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">If at all possible, fasteners (screws, nuts and bolts, clips and rivets) should be eliminated and parts joined by designing them so that they can be snapped or interlocked together. Avoiding the need for fasteners does not mean that components cannot be taken apart. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">On the contrary, parts that snap together may be disassembled easily if the design allows the snap to be pushed back</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">If fasteners cannot be avoided, then one should analyse the kind, variety, material, head-shape and overall geometry of the fasteners to be used in a product.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Obviously the larger the variety the higher the cost. Also if the geometry is not right, automated feeders and screwdrivers cannot be used.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Important issues to consider include:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">length-to-diameter ratio of the screw</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> (to prevent the screw from tumbling in the tube feeding an automated screwdriver) should be 1.5 to 1 and must allow access clearance between the screw head and the wall of the tube wall.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">drive geometry / configuration of the screw head</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">. These include Phillips, hex, Allen, square recess and slotted. The latter is the least desirable shape since it is the most difficult to engage with the screwdriver bit.</font>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">It must be noted, that the techniques and management methods to be discussed in this section can be successfully applied to a wide range of technical and non-technical areas.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Quality Control, steps of control, or KANRI</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Quality Control is the effort of an entire enterprise to develop, design, manufacture, inspect, market and service products that will satisfy the customers at the time of purchase and give them satisfaction for a long time after purchase. The word &quot;quality&quot; applies not only to products but also services, such as design, sales and maintenance.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In order to perform Quality Control (QC) functions effectively throughout all aspects and phases of the enterprise activities <u>all</u> personnel including executives, managers, engineers, administrators, foreman and workers and operators need to participate and collaborate. As the Japanese put it: &quot;The operator's only concern should be quality, not productivity. The foreman on the other hand must deal with productivity as well as quality!&quot;</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Steps of control, or in Japanese KANRI means the continuous check of operations and processes for the sake of complying with standards and well tested instructions. KANRI (originally taught by Deming to the Japanese during his very fist visits to Japan) includes four steps, these are:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>1. Plan.</b> Set the criteria of control, the variables and the objectives</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>2. Do.</b> Ensure that the operation is carried out according to the rules and standards</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>3. Check.</b> Check/study the condition and the results of an operation</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>4. Action.</b> Take actions based on the result of the previous step</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Let us discuss each of these steps in some more detail.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">It is worthwhile remembering that the structured specification and modelling techniques, such as DFD, IDEFo and CIMpgr, are all based on processes and activities, the main target areas of KANRI. For example, the process definitions in a CIMpgr diagram could be tested for accuracy and correctness using the Plan, Do, Check and Action steps.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Plan!</b> As with most things the first step always should be planning and setting the objectives. Plan means: What changes might be desirable? What data are available? Are new observations needed? How are observations to be used? In terms of </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">KANRI</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> this means the following:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Set the criteria of control, set the variables and the objectives</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">&nbsp; (e.g. quality, cost, delivery time, safety, quantity). Set rules that define the criteria accurately (e.g. define acceptable quality, define when is a component defective, or reworkable, define delivery times). Set the criteria what quantity means, or what safety means</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Define the methods required to achieve the set criteria of control.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Typical examples include the following:</font>

					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As a general rule be &quot;problem conscious&quot; and follow clearly defined rules. Observe and analyse the &quot;as is&quot; system, i.e. the current status of the operations or activities. Collect data accurately. Learn to listen. Collect ideas for improvement. Analyse the factors affecting the process or activity.</font><b></b></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Do! </b>Within this step the Concurrent Engineering team needs to ensure that an operation or activity is carried out according to the rules and standards. In terms of KANRI this means the following:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Train the appropriate methods and standards to perform the operation or activity properly</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Perform the operation or activity. Share the problems with everyone (Remember, there are no problems, only opportunities for improvement)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Collect data on the operation or activity according to the performance criteria set</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Check! or Study! Check means: Study the results. What did we learn? What went wrong? What went right? What can be predicted? and How? In terms of KANRI this means checking and evaluating the conditions and the results of the operation or activity as follows:</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Check whether or not the operation or activity was carried out according to the standards and rules set earlier</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Check specified parameters and their values and compare the results against standards and rules set and expected values. (Use statistical methods and experimental design - Taguchi method).</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>Act! or Action!</b> This is the fourth step and is closing the first iteration of the loop. Note, that usually more than one iteration is required. This means: take actions based on the result of the previous step, i.e. adopt the change or abandon it (then repeat the Plan - Do - Check - Act cycle with accumulated knowledge). In terms of KANRI this can be interpreted as follows:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Take remedial measures if an operation is deviating from the previously set standards and rules</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Analyse, identify and eliminate the causes of abnormal results. Take actions faithfully and promptly to avoid the recurrence of the same cause in the future. Note, that accurate records and statistical analysis of collected data can often help to prevent faults because they can show the level of abnormality</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Take actions to improve the entire process or activity as defined by the four KANRI steps of control. Establish a feedback-control system and prevent faults by continuously monitoring and/or controlling sensitive parameters</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">&nbsp;</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As one can see the difficult aspects of this four step analysis include setting the objectives and variables to control and then to actually capture the data promptly and take action as necessary. Since control parameters are often outside the range of a team's responsibility one should make sure that both inside and outside suppliers are aware of the importance of the value of the particular parameter. (Note, that this is one of those areas in which ISO9001 accreditation can be of extreme value to a corporation.)</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The other very important issue here is to make sure that the required data is collected accurately and on time. It is no good finding out faults a few days later when the products have already left the factory or design office.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">There is no doubt that our Japanese colleagues are the masters of gradual improvement and we should collectively learn from each other. As they define it in Japan 'Improvement is an attempt to breakthrough from the present, and control is an effort to prevent slip-off from an improved stage. These two complement each other as two wheels of the same cart to create a better workshop.'</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The key aspects of gradual and systematic improvement are as follows:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">1. Be problem conscious.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> There is no shortage of problems in any office, or factory, or system. Accept problems as opportunities for improvements. Not just the managers, but all members of the organisation should be problem conscious. Start in your own area and gradually expand cutting down on waste.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">2. Act as a team.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> The wisdom of all should be brought together to solve a problem and act effectively. Awareness and sensitivity to what is happening is crucial. Joint lunches, Quality Circles (discussed in more detail later), team meetings, etc. are crucial in terms of developing trust.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">3. Identify problems.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> The Japanese call it MUDA (meaning waste), MURA (irregularity) and MURI (strain). The idea of course is to eliminate MUDA in terms of people, machines, materials and methods</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Due to the importance of MUDA let us discuss the basic principles in some detail concentrating in particular on the teamwork aspects of Concurrent Engineering and the way the Japanese identify problems and act upon them.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>MUDA </b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">MUDA means waste. It means many different types of waste, including: unbalanced workload, long waiting times and uncoordinated action plans between departments, as well as waste in terms of, &quot;is the right man doing the right job?&quot;</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>MURA </b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">MURA means irregularity, or differences and variability caused by men. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Are individual differences wider than normal? Is co-ordination between workers causing unnecessary irregularities? </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Is the workload evenly distributed? Are the peaks preventing workers and managers from performing their jobs properly? </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Is the workload and the type of work balanced in terms of skills, responsibilities and authority? Is proper training provided?</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>MURI </b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">MURI means stress and strain. It reflects on problem areas such as: Is there a shortage of manpower? Is there an opportunity to simplify the operation unloading strain of the operators? </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Is there an opportunity to reduce organisational strain in the design and manufacturing office by organising work and activities better? Is manpower and staffing acceptable? </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Is there a physical strain (e.g. posture, environmental pollution and noise)?</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">To summarize this section let us give a checklist on how to identify design for quality related problems in Concurrent Engineering.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The reader is advised to 'tune' these general questions to the particular system or product analysed. (e.g. 'Is data on quality available?' - can mean quality data on the product, or on the manufacturing system, or on maintenance services. It can mean 'internal' as well as 'external' quality problems.)</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Poka-Yoke is a </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">technique for avoiding simple human error and aiming for zero defects at all levels of work.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> (Poka-Yoke means &quot;mistake-proofing&quot; or &quot;fail-safing&quot;.) </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Although the concept existed for a long time, it was a Japanese manufacturing engineer, Shiego Shingo who developed the idea into a practical methodology. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The fundamental concept of Poka-Yoke is to respect the intelligence, knowledge and experience of machine operators and assembly line workers, designers and manufacturing engineers trying to eliminate the possibility of failure, or defects through design and sound practices.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Poka-Yoke underlines the fact that a </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">good design engineer cannot sit behind closed doors</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> any more, because he, or she needs to know a lot about processes and manufacturing methods too.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Poka-Yoka is emphasising very much the same goals as JIT, (Just-in-time methods), in that 'it is not acceptable to produce even small number of defective components, or products because defects are wasteful' (see our discussion on MUDA again). Poka-Yoke claims that errors can be avoided, although people and machines can make mistakes. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The fundamental concept is that any kind of mistake is made by people and that people make fewer mistakes if they are supported by proper training and by a manufacturing/assembly system which is designed on the basis that errors can always be prevented by sound design methods and experienced people.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Note, that in this sense sampling inspection is by definition not adequate since it allows a percentage of defects however small that defect is. Imagine, a customer getting the odd defective pacemaker, even if it is the only defective product out of a million. Obviously this is a major problem! Poka-Yoka emphasises that one needs to inspect products 100% as they are created, manufactured, assembled, etc. using simple in-process techniques that work in practice.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Poka-Yoke is a technique that can be applied to many different areas of design, manufacture and even services. These are:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Source inspection.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Avoid defective parts or components entering the next process.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">100% inspection</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">. Avoid defective parts by continuously inspecting all processes.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">If an error is detected stop the process</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> immediately (&quot;If there is a good reason for it, you may stop the line...&quot;).</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">All of the above groups focus on human related errors. For example omitted processes, processing errors, errors setting up the machines or workpieces, missing part or using the wrong part, adjustment errors, improperly designed and/or prepared tools and fixtures and others. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">These can be grouped as follows:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Errors due to a misunderstanding</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, e.g. mistakes made, because we jump to the wrong conclusions, before we understand the situation or problem fully. Possible cure: Training, standardisation of procedures, checking the problem in advance</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Errors made due to absentmindedness</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">. These are mistakes without knowing that they have happened. Possible cure: Discipline, training, good organisation of time and workplace, checklists, error detection and alarms, limit switches and counters at the assembly line</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Forgetfulness.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> These are errors mostly due to the lack of concentration. Unfortunately they can cause major disasters. Possible cure: Alerting the operator in advance, checking at various intervals, discipline and training</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Errors made in identification</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, e.g. a label is misread, or two similar parts are mixed up. Possible cure: Vigilance, discipline, training, fail-safe design, error detection and alarms</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Errors due to tiredness or slowness.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> These are errors caused by actions slowed down due to tiredness or an in-ability to make quick decisions. Possible cure:&nbsp; Work organisation and load analysis, discipline, training, work standardisation</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Errors due to a lack of standards.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> If there are no reference values for measured data, or if there are no benchmarked solutions/procedures, errors can occur. Possible cure: Standardisation, accurate instructions, discipline and training in measuring the appropriate data</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Panic and surprise errors,</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> e.g. machine malfunctions, line stoppages, computer break downs, etc. without prior warning. Possible cure: Preventive maintenance, training, safeguards, fail-safe design, well rehearsed procedures</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Errors due to the lack of experience or training</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, e.g. a new operator is not familiar with the settings, etc. Possible cure: Training, checklists, error detection and alarms, limit switches and counters</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Deliberate errors.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Unfortunately some people in some circumstances make deliberate errors either by ignoring regulations and safety guidelines or by other means and can cause serious damage to other operators or to machines.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Possible cure: Fundamental education and training, circumstance analysis by the appropriate experts, or as a last resort removal of the operator, or technician, or engineer, or manager</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">To summarize, </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">mistakes can happen for many reasons</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, but in almost all cases </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">they can be prevented</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> if we make the necessary time and effort to prevent them. We illustrate the above Poka-Yoke principles with practical examples. Try to apply them in your own organisation.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In order to achieve good quality output that satisfies both the inside as well as the outside customers the Concurrent Engineering team must be managed well and must look after its own quality of work. One way of dealing with this is through Quality Circles. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Through Quality Circle activities people get together and openly talk to each other in a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere and try to discuss and solve daily or longer term problems. As the Japanese put it one of the most important objectives of such activities is &quot;to respect humanity and build a happy and bright workshop&quot;.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Quality Circle activities attempt to promote quality control in the workshop and at all levels of the enterprise, including the Concurrent Engineering offices and workshops. Quality Control itself is the effort of an entire enterprise to develop, design, manufacture, inspect, market and service products that will satisfy the customers at the time of purchase and give them satisfaction for a long time after purchase. The word &quot;quality&quot; applies to not only products but also services, such as sales and maintenance.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The most important success factors of Quality Circle activities, with particular interest to Concurrent Engineering include the following:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Self development.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Note the amount of industrial and product design, hardware, software and manufacturing process/quality related knowledge a good Concurrent Engineer working in a CIM team must keep up with.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Voluntary activities</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> are crucial.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Group activities are beneficial to develop respect and team spirit.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Participation by everyone </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">is important.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Application of quality control techniques</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> and statistical methods, in particular for trend analysis, are vital, and the acceptance of QC activities as a form of feedback control is vital.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Mutual development and creativity</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> (e.g. brainstorming and team problem solving) is essential.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Quality consciousness</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, problem consciousness, and a positively critical attitude is healthy and motivating.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">These aspects are essential at all stages of the Quality Circle development process. Note, that it should be a self-development process, not a stage, or forced activity.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">To summarize, with design for manufacture, assembly, quality and maintenance, we are dealing with a very complex research and development problem which includes design, manufacturing, organisational and human aspects too. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In order to be able to deal with the complexity, we often need to change the attitudes and the practices of the accountants, the marketing, design, manufacturing, quality control and maintenance engineers, as well as the customers in order to make sure that there is a better understanding between these disciplines resulting in better products to everybody's benefit.</font></p>
