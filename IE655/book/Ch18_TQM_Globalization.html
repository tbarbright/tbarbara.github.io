					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The term 'globalization' reflects </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">technological advances, that have made it easier and quicker to complete international trade and financial transactions. </font></p>

						<li><font color="#008b8b" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Quality design and TQM standards should be followed</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> in the globalization processes, at all stages, </font>

					</ul>
					<p><font color="white" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">.</font></p>
					<p><font color="maroon" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>What is<a name="Anchor-47857" id="Anchor-47857"></a> Globalization?</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Product, process and service system globalization can be defined in many different ways. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The International Monetary Fund defines globalization as </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'a process, that is beneficial, a key to future world economic development, and also inevitable and irreversible'</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The term sometimes also refers to the </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">movement of people (labor) and knowledge (technology) across international borders.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> There are also broader cultural, political and environmental dimensions of globalization.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Others regard globalization with hostility, even fear, believing that it increases inequality within and between nations, threatens employment and living standards, lowers quality of goods and services, and thwarts social progress.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The term 'globalization' has come into common usage since the 1980s, reflecting </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">technological advances that have made it easier and quicker to complete international trade and financial transactions. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It refers to an extension beyond national borders of the same market forces that have operated for centuries at all levels of human economic activity, in village markets, in urban industries, and financial centers. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The International Monetary Fund claims, that </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'...</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">globalization offers extensive opportunities for truly worldwide development but it is not progressing evenly'. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It also notes, that some countries are becoming integrated into the global economy more quickly than others. </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Countries that have been able to integrate are seeing faster growth, and reduced poverty (although the new wealth created because of globalization efforts is more than often spread unevenly). </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Outward-oriented policies, the potential market size brought dynamism and greater prosperity to much of East Asia, transforming it from one of the poorest areas of the world 40 years ago. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As living standards rose, it became possible to make some progress on democracy and economic issues. Unfortunately due to rapid growth, and other sociopolitical and financial issues the environment and work standards often do not keep up with the advancement of technology. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This creates a situation, in which </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">competition becomes often unfair,</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> in that the West becomes a less attractive investment game, since it is bound to its democratic systems, its expensive, but relatively good quality health care, its environmental protection, minimum wage, and other labor rights, and social justice laws. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Typically, this imbalance is overcome by productivity gains, by automation, by progressive innovation, and better quality, nevertheless often the differences are far too high, as well as the attraction of being local to a massive number of people who's earning and spending power is growing, therefore the game is often lost. But there are some changing signs too... An important reshoring trend is triggered by the low energy cost in the USA (due to natural gas sources), IP theft and protection issues overseas (Intellectual Property), increasing labor cost overseas, as well as very rapidly growing automation and productivity gains in the US by means of automation (as mentioned already above). As an example, when you have robots that can perform over 280 operations in less than a second, human labor cannot cope with that... This clearly indicates, that human labor should be increasingly deployed as thinkers, versus robot competitors... and there is nothing wrong about this!</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Globalization is a fundamental human design, therefore should be supported by all, as long as the game is fair... again, the game MUST be fair...</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">By contrast to globalization, in the 1970s and 1980s when many countries in Latin America and Africa pursued inward-oriented policies, their economies stagnated or declined, poverty increased and high inflation became the norm. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In many cases, especially in Africa, adverse external developments made the problems worse. As these regions changed their policies, their incomes have begun to rise.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The good news is, that besides greed and monopolistic, and feudalistic politics controlling industries and nations in many parts of the world, an important transformation is underway. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Encouraging this trend </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">by nations helping each other to learn how to create wealth,</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> not reversing it by policies, that make them more and more dependent on monopolies run by a small number of greedy people, is the best course for promoting growth, development and poverty reduction. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As an example, a recent study performed by New Jersey (USA) science students indicates, that by teaching farmers in Africa how to separate the fertile seeds from the non-fertile ones typically yields a five-fold (!) increase of the harvest, without using any fertilizers, or genetically modified seeds / food, or any other chemicals added to the process.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Amazingly to achieve this, a family of five or six should spend 2 days of work per year to perform this sorting process to gain 5x growth in output. These are amazing ideas, methods and results, and clearly underline, that the </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">key is to help others, and to help each other to learn how to create new wealth</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, rather than just giving wealth, that is then typically wasted in the streams of corruption...</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The crises in the emerging markets in the 1990s have made it quite evident that the opportunities of globalization do not come without risks. Such risks can arise due to one, or more of the following:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Volatile capital movements,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Risks of social, </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Economic,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Environmental degradation often created by the greed of the investors, and developers, and by poverty. </font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To summarize this section, this should not be a reason to reverse direction, but for all concerned </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">investors should employ ethical, TQM - driven, long - term sustainable investment policies, encourage and embrace policy changes to build strong economies and a stronger world financial system that will produce more rapid growth and ensure that poverty is reduced, and quality of life is improved everywhere in the world. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This is because everybody on planet Earth should have the right to free quality life.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This can only be done, if powerful nations stick together and follow sound environmental protection, labor rights protection, and other democratic / ethical human rights protection policies, that do not allow greedy investors, and local politicians who often support such activities for various financial and other gains, installing factories in third world countries, that have unacceptable pollution levels, or as an example make cars, that have unacceptable emission levels in factory environments, that cause lung cancer, and other long term, often fatal illnesses.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The average income growth might have been remarkable, nevertheless the progress was </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">not evenly dispersed</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">The gap between rich and poor countries, and rich and poor people within countries, have grown. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The richest quarter of the world&rsquo;s population saw its per capita GDP increase nearly six-fold during the century, while the poorest quarter experienced less than a three-fold increase.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The most recent World Economic Outlook studies 42 countries (representing almost 90 percent of world population) for which data are available for the entire 20th century. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It reaches the conclusion that </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">output per capita has risen appreciably but that the distribution of income among countries has become more unequal than at the beginning of the century.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Incomes do not tell the whole story. Broader measures of welfare that take account of social conditions show that some poorer countries have made considerable progress. As an example, as a result of the GDP boom, some low-income countries, have impressive social indicators.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">When analyzing international, global trade, statistics created by the International Monetary Fund show, that </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">developing countries have increased their share of world trade, from 19 percent in 1971, to 29 percent in 1999.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The major regions show great variations. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As an example, the newly industrialized economies (NIEs) of </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Asia have done well, in terms of capital growth, often at a huge price of the environment, while Africa as a whole has performed poorly. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The composition of quality goods and services that countries export is a very important factor in terms of their GDP gains.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The strongest rise by far has been in the </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">export of manufactured goods.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> </font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Globalization has </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">sharply increased private capital flows</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> to developing countries during most of the 1990s. Statistics also shows, that direct foreign investment has become the most important category of capital flows. (Both portfolio investment and bank credit rose but they have been more volatile, falling sharply in the wake of the financial crises of the late 1990s).</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Workers (if allowed...) often move</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> from one country to another partly to find better employment opportunities. (Labour movements in the new, extended Europe is a good example for this trend).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The numbers involved are still quite small, but as an example, in the period 1965-1990, the proportion of labor forces round the world that was foreign born increased by about one-half. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">There is also potential for skills to be transferred back to the developing countries and for wages in those countries to rise. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The important issue is, that in case of hi-tech, lean and flexible manufacturing / assembly, labour cost is only 5-7% of the overall cost. In other words it is NOT only the cheap labour cost, that drives globalization, and outsourcing from the West to third-world nations, and other so called 'cheap labour cost markets', but more importantly </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">the opportunities of developing new markets</font><font size="3" color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, with wast, well organized and controlled populations... teh other key driver is to be locally involved and controlling the process from day one...

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Information exchange is an integral, often overlooked, aspect of globalization. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As a result of information exchange, and technologies, such as eTrade, eBusiness, B2B (Business to Business), the Internet, eLearning, and others, direct foreign investment brings not only an expansion of the physical capital stock, but also </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">technical innovation, including the following: </font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Valuable knowledge about modern design and production methods, integrating </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">TQM and TQC processes, methods, skills, and tools, </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Education and training, that the workforce and their management receives in relationship with the new technology, TQM and TQC processes they have to follow and maintain,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Enginering and business management techniques, </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New knowledge about different export markets, and the </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Various economic policies, that govern such markets, that they have to master and follow. </font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Since the initial cost of the above is typically covered by the investors, the package represents a valuable resource for the developing countries.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The big issue about information exchange in CE and design, is that despite all legal agreements, copyright laws, and design rights laws, in some countries companies heavily steal ideas, product designs and processes. In other words your great idea you worked on for years, invested everything you had... might make money for somebody else... Is this ethical? Of course not.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">How can you fight this? Do you have the legal muscle to go into battle with a large country's huge enterprise and fight your rights? (Many copy-cats don'y even identify their companies... tha tragic fact is that these products are still imported...) </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What should you do to protect your design and IP (Intellectual Property) rights?</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">These are hard pressing questions, and there are no clear answers. We live in an era in which millions of US Dollars worth of illegally copied, fake merchandize reaches the world markets every day... T shirts, video games, DVD videos, medications, cameras, memory chips, cell phones, computer networking servers with extra chips that report back home some interesting traffic (!) and zillions of other products...with famous brandnames, logos, shapes and looks. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">On the top of all this, these fake products often represent good quality, since they were produced on the same machines as the legal, original versions were in the previous shift, by the same workers, in the same factories... Interesting challenge? Try to come up with a feasible strategy on how to protect your globally collaborating development team and product, process, service design know-how.</font></p>
