					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Computer Networking, as an enabling methodology and technology for TQM and TQC systems, with a mission to capture reliable data (usually via sensors) needs:</font></p>
					<ul>

					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This is fundamental because networking for TQM and TQC means </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">sharing and exchanging quality information at all levels of the digital enterprise,</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> including real-time shop-floor processes, as well as management offices; (as they say 'from the shop to the top', and then 'from the top to the shop'; preferably real-time.)</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In order to achieve the maximum benefits of quality lean manufacturing systems operated in digital factories, one of the most important rules to follow is to </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">establish distributed, intranet networking between able people and machines,</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> including the workstations, cells and manufacturing lines, within a line balanced client/server architecture.</font></p>

					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In this Chapter we introduce some of the most important network planning and engineering management principles and rules, and offer simulation examples, that lean manufacturing cell and system designers, and digital factory networkers keen on obtaining quality data in real-time, should keep in mind when preparing for TQM accreditation. (Note, that our methods are generic, analytical and open-source computational, therefore can be applied to a wide-range of application challenges.)</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Our network requirements analysis and planning methodology is based on well established and tested engineering, engineering management and computing principles, as well as on some new, object / component-oriented process modeling and simulation algorithms, and methods, and uses our well established <a href="CB_LibMoreSelfContObjV3/RankyCORA_TemplV5.xls">CORA (Component-oriented Requirements Analysis) tool.</a></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As an example of a study, please review an open-source CORA <a href="RankyCORA_ManufCellsV5.xls">network requirements model</a>.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The core concept is that we always evaluate network customer requirements, various available and feasible new solutions, and then, and only then, design a system, that integrates well with the accurately analyzed / specified environment.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In terms of CE, PLM, TQM and TQC manufacturing networks in digital factories, where total quality can be monitored and controlled, the &lsquo;customer&rsquo; can be several, including:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">An individual human operator, or manager</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> in front of a multimedia workstation, a machine, device, or robot, with its own controller, real-time networked with its sensor-controlled auxiliary devices, and/or tools, safety devices, part orientation and setup tables and devices, pallet changers, conveyors, and others,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">A group, or cell of networked devices, interacting with each other</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, as well as with their line management computer, that is integrated with the factory LANs (local area networks) for integrated production control, management, quality monitoring, machine tool and robot programming, and other purposes, as well as a </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Line of such devices and machines</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, organized into larger systems.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Please note, that the subjects of Computer Networking, Networked Quality Control and Monitoring Processes (and machines with networked smart sensors), and others, are featured in several eBooks in our Case Library, where you can find in-depth analysis and discussion of these very exciting and profitable methods, including a variety of real-world industrial and research case studies, software tools, management techniques, and technologies.

					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">In a recent presentation at ProEngineer in MA, USA, Product Lifecycle Management: What&rsquo;s Real Now, Michael Burkett, Jennifer Kemmeter, and Kevin O'Marah, explained: </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">'An examination of today&rsquo;s Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) products is reminiscent of the parable of the blind men and the elephant, where each perceived something different depending on which part of the elephant they touched'.&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Indeed, the seven offerings that AMR Research examined as part of its deep dive process were more comparatively diverse than those of any other such product examination ever taken.&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The following are our most important findings:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">A single Product Data Management (PDM) foundation is essential, but vendor functional similarity makes selection tricky&#151;industry know-how breaks the deadlock. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Other PLM applications are all over the map and largely immature&#151;a best-of-breed strategy will work well for most users.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">We do not yet see the critical functional mass in PLM offerings for any market that would dictate a single-vendor strategy.&nbsp; We do not believe this will change until the earliest single vendor opportunities coming in Aerospace and Defense (A&amp;D) and Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG). </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">A key reason for vendor and product diversity is the hope that a PLM strategy will link heretofore dissimilar and often warring factions: manufacturing, engineering and design, purchasing, and (increasingly) sales and marketing.&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">It should be no surprise that vendors with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), PDM, Computer-Aided Design (CAD), and services pedigrees have such differing products and approaches.&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Some key findings are as follows:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Technology differences are less about integration than flexibility.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Flexibility is a matter of workflow, data architecture, and scalability.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">A single PDM foundation is essential, but vendor functional similarity makes selection tricky&oacute;industry </font><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">know-how breaks the deadlock.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Typical user stories include the following:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">A contract manufacturer reports that </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">CAD models and Bill of Materials (BOM) files are in disagreement 90% of the time.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">A company reports that </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">material usage across products can only be approximately known</font><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">, and then only after a week of special query programming. </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">A business electronics manufacturer reports that </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">disconnects between sales and engineering product information frequently lead to product being sold that cannot be built.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">It is clear that some approach to consolidation and control of product information is essential as users seek more collaboration in their New Product Development and Introduction (NPDI) processes.&nbsp; The great majority of user references contacted for this study, 85%, had started their PLM strategies with PDM implementations, most seeking product data control and faster engineering change management.&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Many are increasingly looking to PLM as the path to better and faster product innovation, but essentially all agree that PLM needs to be built on PDM. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">When asked about cost and risk for PDM implementations, users reported that data conversion was the biggest problem.&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">A large minority of users, especially in complex discrete engineering industries, has spent over 18 months reconciling product information to populate a central PDM environment.&nbsp; PDM is increasingly viewed as the system of record for all product information.&nbsp; Users trying to increase design reuse to reduce part redundancy want to be able to query a single repository.&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">This repository need not (and probably often cannot) be physically centralized, but users are working to make it logically unified.&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Most vendors offer, and many users employ, a layered or buffered approach to PDM.&nbsp; This is intended to allow two levels of product information control and access.'&nbsp;</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The rigorous design team networking method by which one can achieve the benefits of lean design, manufacturing / assembly, service and IT, and even lean de-manufacturing, and disassembly, is as follows:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">CE/PLM/TQM /TQC networking requirements analysis.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> During this analysis the typical questions we have to ask are as follows: What does the customer want? (Note, that a customer here can be an individual CNC machine, a device, a robot, a robot cell, and others, that want to monitor, test, evaluate, assure various parameters to be within tolerance limits. When performing this step-by-step process analysis, one should always try to satisfy this need at the highest quality and minimum cost. Further questions that should be answered here include the following: How could the processes be simplified (for all key real-time, mission critical, as well as off-line processes)? What are the engineering solutions for satisfying customer needs? How does our competition do? What level of technology (i.e. engineering solutions can the plant accept? (Note, that there is always a cultural issue, that should not be overlooked?)</font>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Object oriented TQM system design. (This is the 'to be' TQM system scenario that needs to be designed. Note, that simulation is a valuable support tool at this stage too. As an example, simulation can be used to predict breakdowns, and their effects on product, process, cost, quality, and others.)</font>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Final documentation.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> Prepare the electronic documentation on the way preferably using interactive multimedia and on-line Internet technology. This will help to satisfy customers as well as save significant funds if the documentation has to be updated. Consider the fact, that this document will be viewed/ read by a variety of engineers, managers, operators around the world, and will be used as a quality guideline, or benchmark. Furthermore, don&rsquo;t ignore the fact that the better, clearer, and more educational your documentation is, the less downtime and technical support expenses you&rsquo;ll face</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Subject to contract, continuous documentation maintenance and support, </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">system administration support and optional formal education at all levels to all involved. (Again, your interactive multimedia Internet based documentation could be the same as your distance learning resource material. You will save a lot.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">The identification of future R&amp;D and other collaborative/ sales opportunities.</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> This reflects all the useful feedback that your audience/ customers will provide. (A good solution for such collaborative feedback is an Internet-based chat group that you can set up to provide a secure environment for all to exchange good ideas on how to improve quality design, manufacturing, service, management and IT aspects, that you can use to improve your business processes, knowledge, and documentation)</font>

					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Simulation,</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> as a method, like most system analysis and design methods, involves </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">systems and models of them. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">A system for our CE/PLM/TQM and TQC network simulation purposes can be defined as a </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">facility of processes, either actual, or planned, or virtual, with all important automation and human resources, computer communication systems, sensors, tools and materials, and fail-safe systems.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As an example, think of a real - world network of welding, or assembly robots, composed of physical sites that can send, route, or receive information, between a network of distributed robot controller PCs, server workstations and various routers and switches. In terms of networking, these sites are referred to as </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">nodes.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In our study, we employ a simulation software package, called IT-Guru, by OPNET Technologies, Inc., USA. This modern, object-oriented simulation system uses communication node objects to represent the physical sites of our networked robots. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Real-world nodes are connected by and communicate across links,</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> represented in IT-Guru by communication link objects. Links carry information over distances and can represent items such as electrical, or fiber optic cables, or even wireless communication links between networked devices.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As communication systems of distributed networked robots become more complex, it is often necessary to view groups of nodes within a network as a single entity. Such a grouping of nodes, along with the links connecting them, is called a sub-network (Ref. IT-Guru, OPNET Technologies)</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As a practical example for such an architecture imagine, that the modern robot controller PC is not just controlling the arm&rsquo;s movements, but often smart sensor equipped welding guns, or active sensory controlled assembly heads, a variety of vision and other non-contact and contact sensors, safety devices, communication between the controller and the rest of the network, and many others.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Therefore, a robot in such a modern, networked system has both an </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">inside-distributed network</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, run by the real-time side of the robot controller, and the </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">higher level robot controller PC,</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> being integrated into a distributed network, such as the robot line.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The term simulation applies to a wide range of methods and applications designed to mimic the behavior of real world, or imagined, virtual world systems. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Simulation for our networked TQM and TQC engineering purposes is usually performed on a computer with powerful software, nevertheless &lsquo;mental simulation&rsquo;, typically preceding any computerized work is a valuable and very powerful engineering problem solving method too, because it enables the system analysts and engineers to think of real-world, or imagined (i.e. virtual) experiences and reason over which parameters and values are truly important, and which are ignorable. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">In terms of supporting this stage of reasoning with an analytical, quantitative and computational approach, we recommend our <a href="CB_LibMoreSelfContObjV3/RankyCORA_TemplV5.xls">CORA, Component-oriented Requirements Analysis</a>, and our <a href="CB_LibMoreSelfContObjV3/RankyTemplatePFRAver5.xls">PFRA, Process Failure Risk Analysis software tools</a>; (Both methods are described in more detail in other Chapters in this eBook publication, as well as in other eBook publications in our Case Library; please look up: <a href="http://www.cimwareukandusa.com">http://www.cimwareukandusa.com</a>).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Following our integrated quality approach to networking, we should </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">select our vendors</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, based on our requirements analysis results. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As an example, when selecting the robot and system integration vendors, one should be prepared to be able to answer the following questions:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Does the solutions provider have successful, long term experience with the methods and technologies you require in the particular (e.g. automotive) industry?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Did you check the references in detail? Did you visit them, seen the systems and talked to the people who actually use it every day?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Does the solutions provider offer a scalable, flexible, lean, reconfigurable, modular solution? (You never know what the future brings... you have to be lean, agile and stay flexible.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Does the solutions provider support open standards? ... and links to intranets/ Internet/ the client - server networking architecture? </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">How difficult is to 'plug-and-play' new welding/ assembly robots/ devices into such networks? </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">What data can be communicated via such networks and for what purposes? (Could include real-time sensor feedback, smart sensor integration, production control, quality control, remote monitoring of robots, etc.) Did you check this out in detail or just read the robot's user and service manuals...?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Can the solutions provider offer expertise all along the project from requirements analysis, through system analysis, system design, integration, validation, implementation and maintenance/ service/ upgrade?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">What if something goes wrong? ... or during the project major changes occur (e.g. scale down, or scale up, or focus shift)? How would your solutions provider react to that?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Does the solutions provider understand management of change? Can they integrate the new robot/ machine/ process into your existing design/ manufacturing/ assembly/ management/ quality assurance culture?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Do they help engineers, technicians, operators and maintenance staff to learn about the new system/ process? </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Do they have on-line. and/or multimedia based learning tools and resources? (Note, that educated operators, engineers and managers make the difference! The training expense associated with the use of advanced technologies may be holding back small manufacturers from using hi-tech solutions).</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Do they offer you access to some of the development tools (e.g. software) that you might need to customize your system?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Is your solutions provider prepared to help you to develop new, more advanced welding/ assembly robot and automation strategies and systems that will create wealth for you? (Do they understand this and support you all the way, or ...?)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Can the solutions provider evaluate the economic benefits you'll gain? Are these calculations realistic? Did you ask an expert / your team to check the best and worst scenarios?</font>
					</ul>
					<p></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Anything else, that we or you have forgotten? Ask your team, and your vendors... continuously debate the above issues... brainstorming is essential to get the best results in this case.</font></p>

					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Following our organization-wide engineering network architecture, including the Internet, our network is integrated with the machine controller CNCs, robot cell/ line network via sub-networks. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Before running this simulation model, and discussing the results, we introduce some basic network design and simulation methods, principles and terminology following the IT-Guru notation (as in IT-Guru, by OPNET Technologies, USA.)</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Sub-network Modeling</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In terms of the way IT-Guru handles sub-networks, a sub-network contains other network objects and abstracts them into a single object. A sub-network can encompass a set of nodes and links to represent a physical grouping of objects (this can be a local area network of CNC machine, or robot PC controllers) or it can contain other sub-networks (for example including the material handling system control of the line).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Sub-networks within other sub-networks form the hierarchy of the network model. This hierarchy can then be extended as required to model the structure of the network. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A sub-network is considered the parent of the objects inside of it, and the objects are the children of the sub-network. The highest level sub-network in the network hierarchy does not have a parent, therefore it is the top sub-network, or global sub-network. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Sub-networks can be created and interconnected within this top level, or within other sub-networks.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Sub-networks provide a powerful mechanism for manipulating complex networks by breaking down the system's complexity through abstraction. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As an example, a large network of hundreds of CNC devices and robots with many components can be segmented based on the proximity, connectivity, or other architectural considerations of its elements. (For example, sub-network objects can represent networked robot cells, or lines, or design / quality control / robot programming office LANs (local area networks) within an automotive factory).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Following this model, within each robot line, sub-network objects can represent each robot cell or design, or programming department sub-network. In IT-Guru, other than the objects it contains, the primary attributes of a sub-network are its geographical position and size. However, these attributes can be ignored when a sub-network is used strictly to abstract other network level objects or when sub-networks exist independently from each other.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Attributes</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">IT-Guru allows the networking engineer to manipulate attributes in many ways, including the following:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">setting attribute values for a single object or a group of objects,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">promoting attributes to specify their values when a simulation is run,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">creating new attributes,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">defining attribute properties,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">saving attribute properties for reuse with other attributes.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Three types of attributes may comprise an object. These types can be as follows:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">built-in attributes,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">model attributes, and</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">extended attributes.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Built-in attributes provide basic information about an object. They specify information such as the object &rsquo;s name, location in the work space, and graphic representation. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Built-in attributes are characteristic of each object type. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">When an object is created in IT-Guru, the program automatically specifies initial values for these attributes. (These values can naturally be edited, depending on what devices, or objects, and protocol stacks the network designers want to simulate).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Model attributes add information to a node or link object. They determine how the object behaves in a network model by specifying protocols, data rates, and similar information. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Model attributes automatically become part of any object using that model. The model developer defines model attributes and sets initial values for them.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Extended attributes are optional model attributes that the model developing engineer can add to an object, thus further customizing its behavior in a network model. Support for extended attributes must be provided in a model by the model developer.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In IT-Guru, all attributes share a set of basic properties. Attribute properties define the attribute, specifying information such as its name, data type, and allowed values. These properties are generally fixed, but can be given different values in some cases (IT-Guru, OPNET Technologies, 2002).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Communication Nodes</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Communication nodes exist within sub-networks and represent network devices that transmit and receive information. Node behavior is determined by its node model.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The node model specifies the node&rsquo;s internal structure and can be specified via its model attribute node object, that is said to be an instance of its node model.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Distinct instances of the pieces of equipment (such as a robot controller, called &lsquo;client&rsquo; in our model) are independent of each other in a real network, although they may have identical capabilities. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A network model can contain any number of communication nodes, using the same, or different node models.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Communication Links and Channels</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Links in IT-Guru allow nodes to communicate with each other using structured messages called &lsquo;packets&rsquo;. When a packet is given to a transmitter in a source node, it is conveyed over a link to a receiver in a destination node.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A communication channel can be thought of as a pipe, where packets are placed in one end by a transmitter channel and retrieved at the other end by a receiver channel. If a link has multiple communication channels, it can be thought of as a bundle of pipes, each one conveying packets from the source node to the destination node (IT-Guru, OPNET Technologies, USA).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">IT-Guru supports two types of links: point-to-point, and bus. Each link type provides a fundamentally different types of connectivity. Point-to-point links connect a single source node to a single destination node, whereas bus links connect each node of a fixed set to all others in the particular set.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Packets carry information and can be sent between transmitters and receivers. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In our example, packets can carry robot programs, when uploaded from the design/ programming office servers to the robot lines, and then to the individual CNCs, or robots, or parts of them, if there is a need for an update, or edit, or quality control, production control, maintenance and other data. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As an example, </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">packets can include mission critical, &lsquo;panic&rsquo; related real-time TQC data</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> between the robot controller PCs and the line servers.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Packets are data structures consisting of storage areas called fields and can either be formatted, or unformatted. Formatted packets have fields designed according to a packet format , which specifies the packets&rsquo; field names, data types, sizes, and default values. Formatted packets can be read by corresponding communication protocols only. Unformatted packets have no pre-defined fields (IT-Guru, OPNET Technologies)</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">. </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In IT-Guru, packet formats are pre-defined and typically named according to the model in which they are intended to be used.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b"><b>Evaluation of the Network Simulation Results</b></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The goal of most TQM / TQC simulation scenarios is to evaluate some aspect of a system&rsquo;s key characteristics, their behavior or performance, and to quantify, typically in terms of statistics, the results, and then use the results for decisions. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This requires a simulation environment with software tools that provide insight into a model&rsquo;s dynamic operation. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Based on IT-Guru&rsquo;s in-depth analysis, the network engineering analyst can collect object, scenario-wide and global statistics as follows:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Object statistics</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> are collected from individual objects. They allow the network engineering analyst to evaluate the performance of specific network nodes or links (a single hub&rsquo;s Ethernet delay, or a server balancing change, as in our example).</font>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Scenario-wide object statistics</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> are collected from all relevant objects in a network (for example, Ethernet delay for every node). They allow the network engineering analyst to easily monitor the performance of all objects of a specific type.</font>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Global statistics</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> are collected from the entire network. They represent results that apply to the network as a whole (such as global end-to-end delay) and let the designers and management analyze aspects of the network&rsquo;s overall performance.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">More specifically, IT-Guru offers the following types of statistics, when analyzing networks:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Queue Size, </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Available Space, </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Overflow Occurrences,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Delay</font>
						<li>I<font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">nter-arrival Times,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Packet Sizes,</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Throughput, </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Utilization, </font>

						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Collisions, and</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Application-Specific Statistics Defined By A Model Developer</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Because there are many possible statistics to collect during a network simulation study, the data files would quickly grow past practical use if the simulation program recorded them all. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Therefore, the analyst must specifically select the statistics that is valuable for the particular study to collect before running a simulation (Ref. IT-Guru, OPNET Technologies). </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As in our simplified example, based on the plotted graphs and screens, management can easily evaluate the need of the balanced server architecture, and even investigate &lsquo;what if&rsquo; scenarios further, without committing themselves to major upfront investments.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As a final thought in this Chapter, consider the power and the opportunities of setting up sensory feedbck-controlled TQM / TQC networks in various remote factories, that you can then optimize (and hopefully keep within predefined variation) via neetworked data analysis.</font></p>
