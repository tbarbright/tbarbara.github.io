In most cases you are looking for identifying and analyzing objects and processes first to establish the &quot;as is&quot; scenario, or system.</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When you </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">find the objects, immediately analyses their behavior</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> (i.e. the processes they perform). This will help you to see most of the 'gray donkeys in the fog'.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Idea generation</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> (so that you have a wide decision space to navigate within and you understand your boundaries).</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Design the new system with its objects, classes and relationships.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Decision making</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, most importantly by navigating through objects and their classes, and their behavior throughout the project.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Object oriented, self contained, well designed quality documentation,</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> intermediate and/ or final report writing and presentation.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Feedback loops</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> and iterative improvements throughout the entire process within and/or outside the team for supporting the team.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The Team Report Document, submitted to your instructor (or manager, or team mates) at various stages of your project should be used as </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">the basis for your final documentation.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> Since in most cases you are asked to put together a professional team presentation at the end of each module, or phase of each project, we strongly recommend that you keep these reports in an electronic format. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Furthermore, as a basic principle we strongly recommend that you put your thoughts together as if they were objects (and / or components) that eventually have to perform a task as an </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">integrated system</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">. (Object oriented thinking will be beneficial throughout your efforts when you analyze, develop, implement, validate, integrate, document, disassemble, maintain, etc. your work).</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">When </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">documenting electronically</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> a simple word processing tool with some inserted images, line diagrams and graphics is adequate, however there are some better tools, such as web-authoring tool that enable you to create hyperlinks between text, images and even sound and digital video objects. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The concept of hyper-linking is very useful</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, and since the tendency is to put all documents on-line on the web, or the company intranet, the earlier you learn this method and become experienced actually doing it every day, the better!</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Before guiding you in more detail, let us explain why you need to pay attention to creating quality reports and document your own, or your team's work in a professional way:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Notes and accurately recorded data</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> that can be turned into information; reasoned upon can be turned into knowledge and decisions. (Obviously inaccurate data can spell disaster!)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Documentation is a method of </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">communicating with parties that did not experience the actual demonstration</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, experiment, or other events. </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Insurance companies and various legal bodies require professional documentation standards to </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">establish accurate facts</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">. This is true for engineering and other systems too.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Your thoughts are organized as you write documents.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> In other words, the document writing process structures your mind and helps you to focus, to decide upon contents, priorities, structure, levels and other major issues.</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Documents can be used for quality assurance and/or quality improvement purposes.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"> (There is no perfect document, including this one... nevertheless you can continuously improve it and achieve a desired level of perfection).</font>
						<li><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Documents can be used for further research</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">, for data mining and distributed project control and management in many areas.</font>
					</ul>

These are some important rules to follow when you present:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong>The fundamental idea behind communication is to:</strong></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">1. Take a picture/ video clip from your own head,</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">2. Explain it however you can,</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">3. Have your audience re-build the picture / video clip within their minds.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Whether the copy of the picture matches the original will depend on how well the message was conveyed. Ideally though the process should be interesting for the listener (and encourage them to stay awake) while building your credibility.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong>During your presentation focus on the following:</strong></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">1. Introduce your project objectives</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">2. Discuss content you have created, based on your web page</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">3. Summarize your results and explain possible further work (as a truly lifelong learner...)</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Make sure you follow these rules:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">1. Clarity of Interaction:</font><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"> Both parties are responsible for understanding the message at hand. Even the most confident public speaker in the world could not succeed if their audience is asleep. But if the message is clear and concise then you&rsquo;re at least halfway there. When interacting you are trying to get a reaction from the audience.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">2. Confidence, correctness and command of your topic</font><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"> are crucial to showing that you know what you are talking about. The audience&rsquo;s image of you will improve dramatically if they see confidence. During this process, it is also important to earn the listeners' trust, as well as demonstrate &lsquo;what&rsquo;s in it for them&rsquo; by paying attention to you. By adjusting your presentation to the type of audience, it shows an extra effort to them, and genuine care on your part that you want them to understand the message.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">3. Communicate the listener&rsquo;s incentive right from the start.</font><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"> Word choice is also important. Be aware of &lsquo;hot phrases&rsquo; for your audience. Recent news or sensitive issues can throw them off unexpectedly. If they become defensive in the middle of what you&rsquo;re saying because of a poor word choice, it can be difficult to get them back on track.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">4. Keep in mind, that according to major studies, only:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">7% of communication is your word choice,<br>
							38% is inflection and tone, and<br>
							55% is non-verbal.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Clearly, it is just as important what you do with your body as with your mouth and your brain.</font></p>

							</b></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Your instructor (or manager, or team mate) will summarize his or her overall impressions of your work here. Consider them well and ask for clarification if anything is unclear.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Always be polite and realistic when you communicate with your professor (or manager, or team members). It is worthwhile to establish a professional approach here too.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Don&rsquo;t make arrogant comments, or claim, that due to other activities you didn't have enough time to complete the assignment in question. This implies to the professor/ manager that the other activity was more important for you... This will kill your reputation for good! On an equal note, don't let your team members down. It is unfair to ask them to do your work too, unless you have a professional reason (e.g. illness) for doing so.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Furthermore don't claim that you had to rush because you bought a ticket and you have to fly away, or because your car or computer has broken down, or because you have lost your disk, etc. These are old, well known tricks... if you had 4-5 months to complete a project, why are you coming up with such crazy excuses at the deadline? </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">Face, accept and admit your own mistakes. Nobody is perfect. Learn from your mistakes. That is the only fair and professional approach. Follow these rules, else nobody will want to work with you again...</font></p>
