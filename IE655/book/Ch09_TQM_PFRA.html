					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The purpose of this Chapter, is to introduce our Process Failure Risk Analysis (PFRA) method and software tool, in the quality-focused design engineering (CE) context,</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> with real-world and R&amp;D challenges, and cases. The purpose of failure risk analysis in the design (CE) process is to try to evaluate and then avoid potential product, process and/or service failures as early as possible.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Furthermore, this Chapter illustrates further our novel approach to applying </font><font size="3" color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">process modeling, requirements analysis, risk management, and risk analysis as an integrated approach</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> to problem solving. The purpose of the Risk Management Process is to identify, analyze, treat and monitor the risks continuously. The Risk Management Process is a continuous process for systematically addressing risk throughout the life cycle of a system or software product or service. It can be applied to risks related to the acquisition, development, maintenance or operation of a system.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A potential failure mode is the manner in which a product, or process, or operation (or in other words, one or more process steps, grouped into a sequence of operations) may fail to meet its purpose, expressed in terms of a component / part/ object, key quality characteristics.</font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Our process-related failure risk analysis method </font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">belongs to the family of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) methods, and is part of our TQM and Six-Sigma approach. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It represents a systematic, rule-based, quantitative and open-source computational method developed by Ranky first for disassembly (DFRA), and then for other processes (PFRA) to identify and minimize potential failure risks, and / or failures of processes in general, including disassembled sub-assemblies, objects and components, and their effects on the customer.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">PFRA is a Team Oriented Problem Solving (TOPS) method, aimed at minimizing dissatisfaction, and financial loss for process related failure risks. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">PFRA is applied during the planning stages of a process, and then updated on a regular basis to document changes. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">It addresses negative quality</font><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> and is primarily concerned with potential events, that can make any process, including service, or even a disassembly process, or the harvested components, fail. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Our approach is component-oriented, meaning that as we analyze and decompose the product / process (based on our object-oriented process modeling method, CIMpgr), or as we disassembly the product, and review the DBOM (Disassembly Bill Of Materials) file, the DFRA team focuses on each subassembly and then component. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This Chapter describes the methodology, offers an insight into the rule-base, and gives some application examples for assessing process-related failure risk using our PFRA spreadsheet-based software tool.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">PFRA helps the TQM-focused engineering team to work through an analytical, quantitative, open-source computational model, to understand the problems process planning engineers, line managers and process operators face, then see the solutions they have come up with, and then apply the learned problem solving skills to other, new challenges by understanding some of the following concerns:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What could go wrong with the product or the processes involved? (Example: <a href="MoreMedia2/Dubai-DesertSafari-Ranky-Shrt-Clip.mov">Desert exploration with SUVs</a> near Dubai.) Other examples: when disassembling the product / or executing the process, like assembling the product, or one or more of its components?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">How badly might it go wrong, and what could the financial loss be? (As an example, review the <a href="MoreMedia2/Toyota-Honda-FloorMat.mov">Toyota floor mat design video</a> clip.)</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Which are the highest risk processes / operations when working on the product?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What needs to be done to prevent failures?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What tools and fixtures are required to prevent failures, and reduce the risk?</font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What education is needed for line management and operators to reduce, or prevent failures?, and </font>
						<li><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Others.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Our generic approach follows the logic, that in industry different failure risks, and/or modes, and their effects are typically analyzed by a team of engineers working with some objective, cross functional teams, representing &quot;fresh eyes&quot;, new thinking, new fields of expertise, and new ideas.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If teams operate on a global basis this task becomes more complex, and therefore utmost attention should be paid by everybody in the team to help each other to prevent failures.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Please note, that the subject of Process-related Failure Risk Analysis is featured in several eBooks in our Case Library, where you can find in-depth analysis and discussion of this very exciting and profitable method, including a variety of real-world industrial and research case studies, software tools, management techniques, and technologies. </font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Just as failure modes and their effects, risk, risk analysis, and risk management can be defined in a variety of different ways too. In this eBook we'll follow the IEEE / ISO definitions (Ref.: ISO/IEC 12207:2008(E) IEEE Std 12207-2008) as well as the EN ISO 13849-1: standard in terms of risk identification and reduction when designing safe machines and systems.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">For our sustainable green engineering purposes, risk can be defined as follows:</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong><em>risk:<br>
								</em></strong>- the possibility of incurring loss; a hazard<br>
							- a chance of loss or other event on which a claim may be filed<br>
							- the type of such an event, such as breakdown, pollution, fire, or theft, or other reasons<br>
							- the scope, scale and the amount of the claim should such an event occur<br>
							- a person or thing considered with respect to the characteristics that may cause an insured event to occur</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong><em>at risk: <br>
								</em></strong>- vulnerable; likely to be lost or damaged<br>
							- vulnerable to machine, and/or environment, and/or personal damage, to the extent that an agency might take protective responsibility</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong><em>take or run a risk to proceed in an action without regard to the possibility of danger involved in it:<br>
								</em></strong>- to expose to danger or loss; hazard, most importantly environmental hazard, that is, or can effect people and living objects<br>
							- to act in spite of the possibility of (injury or loss) (e.g. SCUBA diving to evaluate the environmental state of a reef with an ecological mission in mind) (More at: <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/risk">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/risk</a>) size.</font></p>

In other words, the (internal, or external) customer will not notice the failure, because only a non-vital fault was noticed. </font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">As an example, consider surface finish, slight fan noise, or similar 'fault'.

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular"><b>If Rating = 3</b>, then this means, that due to the disassembly process performed, there is a Slight Effect on performance, or process operation.</font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular">The internal and/or external customer will be slightly disappointed, nevertheless no vital fault will be noticed. </font></p>
