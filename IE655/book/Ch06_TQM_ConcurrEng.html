					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Quality must be </font><font color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">designed into every product and process.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> Concurrent, or simultaneous, or parallel engineering, within a globally collaborative, sustainable green quality framework, enables this wonderful concept to be implemented.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There are many methods and solutions to innovate and develop new products and processes, to cut down waste and to improve an organization, a design office, a manufacturing enterprise, or a product. One major discipline is Concurrent Engineering (CE). CE is also widely known as Simultaneous, or Parallel Engineering, or Integrated Product and Process Design (IP<sup>2</sup>D) within a TQM system.</font></p>
					<p><font color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Concurrent Engineering represents a structured (or in IT terms object-oriented),</font><font color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> logical framework which supports a systematic approach to the integrated, concurrent design of products, and their related processes</font><font color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, including manufacture, and support.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It is essential to understand that none of the Concurrent Engineering, with green PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) , with Computer Integrated Manufacturing, and integrated supply chain management methods work in practice unless they are:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Applied to all levels</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> of the enterprise,</font>
						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Introduced </font><font color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">gradually</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">,</font>
						<li><font color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Managed</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> professionally by people who understand and fully support them.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In order to promote this thought, CIM, or Computer Integrated Manufacturing, is now often referred to as the lean, or agile, or adaptive, or reconfigurable manufacturing and design system, preferably implemented in a networked digital factory, in which every major process, and resource is a web-page (<a href="../CIMwWWW/wwwUpload/IEEE_SFMay2002_UML/IEEE_SFMay2002_UML.html#Anchor-42324">for more on this topic please read the article on the web in ADAM with IT...</a>)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The aims of globally collaborative CE, or integrated lean, or agile, or adaptive, manufacturing and design, within a TQM framework, are very clear: get rid of waste, organize your knowledge, and focus on new opportunities driven by the customer. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">These goals can be achieved by integrating</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Information flow</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, meaning objects, and object classes communicating with each other, including humans who can trust each other, </font>
						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Material flow</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, meaning actual material or information about material being moved in the factory, as well as between factories, and these processes are highly visible, because visual factories show waste very quickly to everyone,</font>
						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Processes</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, such as design, manufacturing, marketing, service, quality control, and others, in our factories (i.e. the internal and external supply chains) in order to improve quality and productivity, and create wealth for several product life-cycles.</font>
					</ul>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In other words, </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">Computer Integrated Manufacturing, adaptive supply chain management, and collaborative Concurrent Engineering, integrated with the TQM systems approach address the entire enterprise</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">, including humans and machines, business systems, product design, process planning, manufacturing planning, the shop floor, packaging and maintenance, for several life-cycles, via internal, as well as external </font><font color="#008b8b" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">supply chains.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To summarize, CE should be of interest to individuals and managers, concerned with minimizing lead time, project development cost and time to market new products, and / or services. </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#008b8b">The key concept here is that the desired product quality should be designed into the product at an agreed cost and time frame.</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">In contrast to the old, conventional, or sequential product design method, Concurrent Engineering focuses on customer satisfaction, on teamwork as well as on Design for Manufacturing, Design for Assembly, Quality and Total Lifecycle issues.

				  <li>                  <span class="wwq">Design reviews can and should be conducted at several phases of the design process. This reduces waste, and unnecessary cost and time to market delays. Design reviews also play a crucially important role in safety. </span>                  
				  <li><span class="wwq">The ultimate design review, if successful, triggers product, process and/or service system improvements (a.k.a. continuous quality improvements) in all aspects, and eventually supports a successful product launch or product release.&nbsp;In many safety critical, and often harsh environment targeted industries, such as in underwater exploration, aerospace, automotive mobility, robotics, computer numerical controlled machines, and others, the conduct of design reviews is compulsory as part of design controls. (In this eBook we have included many practical, real-world examples, industrial and research use cases, based on sound lean six-sigma methods, tools and technologies developed by the author as well as by others. </span>                  
				  <li><span class="wwq">All of these are excellent examples of various stages of design reviews.) A design review is a milestone within a product development process whereby a design is evaluated against its requirements in order to verify the outcomes of previous activities and identify issues before committing to, and if needed, to prioritize further work. The ultimate design review, if successful, triggers the product launch or product release. The most important purpose of a design review is to evaluate a product, process or service and compare the results with set goals. </span>                  
				  <li><span class="wwq">These set goals can sometimes be defined by objective functions. These can be very complex functions because the parameters are maybe not all known at this stage of the design, or because of uncertainty, or because the attributes as well as their values / tolerances are not all known at this stage. </span>                  
				  <li><span class="wwq">The deviation from the set goals gives the design review (auditing) team an opportunity to support realistic, and appropriate design change if necessary. Also, here KPIs (Key Process Indicators) are crucial for each process step at each level. Process steps offer here the opportunity to evaluate a transfer function with a particular set of KPIs in mind. </span>
				    <p class="wwq">Because processes can be layered, and because at the lower layers processes are less complex, this becomes a less complicated task than initially thought of&hellip; in other words, this is a very plausible and realistic way to go even in complex systems, like a 787 landing gear, or an automobile power train, and others. (You&rsquo;ll see several more design review examples in this eBook: <a href="Boeing-787-Images/IMG_5913-Copyright-PaulRanky.JPG">Boeing 787-image1</a>, <a href="Boeing-787-Images/IMG_5916-Copyright-PaulRanky.JPG">Boeing 787-image2</a>, <a href="Boeing-787-Images/IMG_5922-Copyright-PaulRanky.JPG">Boeing 787-image3</a>, <a href="Boeing-787-Images/IMG_5926a-Copyright-PaulRanky.jpg">Boeing 787-image4</a>, <a href="Boeing-787-Images/IMG_5927-Copyright-PaulRanky.JPG">Boeing 787-image5</a>, <a href="Boeing-787-Images/IMG_5928a-Copyright-PaulRanky.jpg">Boeing 787-image6</a>, and <a href="Boeing-787-Images/IMG_5912-Copyright-PaulRanky.JPG">Boeing 787-image7</a> are good examples for CE, PLM as well as for the importance of conducting design reviews at various stages of product/process/system development.)</p>
