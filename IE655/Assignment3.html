                <p>Virtual Company Name: Titan International Manufacturing</p>

                <p>Titan International Manufacturing's goal is to create environmentally friendly, smart, and sustainable washing machines and driers for home use. Every day millions of Americans wash their laundry in so-called "dumb washing machines" that are old, outdated, energy inefficient, and lack the capabilities to filter harmful laundry byproducts like microplastics from entering the environment. Our smart washer will feature an intuitive interface and internet capabilities all with the goal of reducing waste.</p>

                <h2>Collaborating Companies:</h2>
                <h3>Tosei America Inc:</h3>
                <p>Tosei America is a manufacturing company specializing in measuring equipment and small mechanical and electrical components. We are partnering with Tosei to leverage their expertise in manufacturing highly precise machinery for taking measurements. We will be co-developing technology with them to measure the amount of plastic debris captured by our machines. We are confident Tosei can provide this to us.</p>
                <h3>WAGO:</h3>
                <p>WAGO is a manufacturer of electrical components ranging from simple wires and connectors to industrial and maratime control systems. From the ground up our manufacturing process needs to be green and the best way to achieve that is through a high degree of reliable automation. As sophisticated automated machines themselves our smart washing machines will require many electrical control components as well.</p>
                <h3>MPAL:</h3>
                <p>MPAL is a manufacturer specializing in the creation of custom tools and machining for various applications. We will use them to design some of the more specialized machines that we will be using to assemble the washing machines. An efficient washing machine requires many sensitive components that must be manufactured to a high degree of quality.</p>
                <h3>Modern Machine Shop:</h3>
                <p>Modern Machine Shop is a media brand which reports on the American CNC and metalworking industries. They also produce and maintain multimedia resources for researching processes related to machining and metalworking and for locating suppliers of equipment and services. We will be using their services to help build our manufacturing facility and train our workers.</p>

                <h2>FEMA/DRFA:</h2>
                <p>We performed an analysis of the filter install process for the Smart Wash Washing Machine. Based on this analysis we found that our greatest risk comes with our machine filter tests with an accumulated RPN of 4435.20. Our pressure test system needs to be more reliable to reduce the occurrence of false positives and false negatives. A false negative is more damaging as it could lead to a customer receiving a defective machine. The value here is particularly concerning as it reflects a high rate of failure of our pressure tests and hose fittings. </p>
                <p>The high failure rate of pressure tests may be related to the high failure rate of the hose connection process with a RPN of 336.96. In turn we also noted that the filters had a high chance of becoming damaged during loading on the conveyor belt with an RPM of 280.28. If we can remove human error from this process it should help us down the line with our failed filter installations.</p>
                <p>Based on this analysis we propose the following corrective actions:</p>
                <p>Design a new process for loading filters onto the conveyor belt.</p>
                <p>Re-evaluate filter inspection criteria.</p>
                <p>Examine and adjust hose connection machine.</p>
                <p>Adjust pressure test criteria.</p>

                <h2>Ranky-Weibull Calculator:</h2>
                <p>The Ranky-Weibull calculator can characterize failure distributions of our filter component. It has two basic parameters shape (β) and scale (α).</p>

                <p>The average failure time for 20 samples was 1.84162 sec.<p>
                <p>α which indicates the spread is 1.53.</p>
                <p>β which indicates whether the failure rate is increasing, constant, or decreasing is 2.35.</p>
                <p>β > 1 increasing failure rate.</p>
                <p>β = 1 constant failure rate.</p>
                <p>β > 1 increasing failure rate.</p>
                <p>Since β is 2.35, the samples have an increasing failure rate.</p>
                <p>This high rate of failure agrees with the results of the DRFA sheet. We need to refine our filter process.</p>

                <h2>Images:</h2>
                <p>This underwater camera housing is poorly designed as evidenced by the following pictures. </p>
                <p>IMG_1864: We can see rust and corrosion present on several metal components. The materials chosen here were of poor quality and were probably unsuited for underwater exploration in harsh environments which is strange considering this is an underwater camera housing.</p>
                <p>IMG_1685: The plastic housing shows signs of pitting. This may mean the material is not high quality. We can also see on the lens ring we have some very small screw holes. This will be very difficult to adjust and have a high probability of getting lost on a dive boat or underwater.</p>
                <p>IMG_1688: The scratches in the casing may indicate that the material is too soft to be used in a harsh underwater environment. We would expect this housing to come into contact with rocks and coral which could cause damage.</p>
                <p>IMG_1689: The lens installs on the black ring with very small screws. This may be difficult for a diver to manipulate especially if they are wearing gloves.</p>
                <p>IMG_1692: The inside of the housing is very tight and it may be difficult to fit the camera inside. The controls which thread through the case may not seal correctly and allow moisture to penetrate the case.</p>
                <p>IMG_1693: The bolts holding the handle to the housing show signs of wear and corrosion which may make them more difficult to assemble. The handle is on a sliding mount which may be difficult to tighten which could lead to the handle sliding around. The screws would also be easy to lose in the water or on a boat.</p>
                <p>IMG_1695: This light has a lot of exposed hardware that could easily corrode. The screws show some signs of stripping which indicates they may be overtightened which is a manufacturing defect.</p>
                <p>IMG_1696: This hand screw is very bulky but at the same time may be too difficult to manipulate while wearing dive gloves.</p>
                <p>IMG_1697: The inset screw on this part will be difficult to reach with anything but a long screwdriver. For serviceability it would be useful to have this screw flush mounted so a coin could be used as a makeshift driver.</p>
                <p>IMG_1698: This electrical component may be exposed to seawater. It appears improperly sealed.</p>
                <p>IMG_1699: This electrical connector has failed. There appears to be no easy way to remove the broken plastic piece. The posts on this connector are very long and may be easily bent.</p>
                <p>IMG_1701: The screw connector seems very small and may be hard to manipulate with gloves. The screw can also become stripped and be impossible to move.</p>
                <p>IMG_1702: The pouch could fray and cause the box inside to fall out. It appears there are already signs of wear on the nylon.</p>
                <p>IMG_1703: The plastic material has broken off and become stuck. The connection pins also appear to be very long and may be hard to connect without bending.</p>
                <p>IMG_1704: This cap appears very small and would be hard to manipulate with gloves on. It also seems like it would be very easy to lose on a boat or underwater</p>

                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>In this project we applied the CORA methodology to design and requirements analysis. Requirements gathering is an extremely important part of engineering. Many projects fail because they missed requirements. Scope change can be an expensive mess later in the project and should be caught earlier if possible.</p>
                
                <h2>Social Networking:</h2>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=338205>Article one</a> is on trends in the fashion industry for 2019. There is a greater shift towards automation with some predicting automation taking over simple garments by 2025. In the more immediate future we will see shifts in which countries serve as suppliers and which as consumers. There was general agreement that the move towards automation will be good for fashion as many factories pay basically slave wages to workers but some had concerns that the automation trend would push these people out of the labor market altogether.</p>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=338209>Article two</a> discuss how acquiring new customers may be a better long term strategy than upselling existing customers. The argument is that existing customers have a maximum potential revenue they can give you while expanding the customer base is theoretically a much larger pool. Several members were skeptical that existing customers weren't as important as new ones as losing customers is bad for business. Danial raised the point that the article was more focused on marketing dollars being focused on new customers than old ones. Customer service is still important. All generally agreed that expansion to new customers was harder than maintaining and growing old accounts. </p>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=338212>Article three</a> is on a new fabric derived from wood called Ioncell. The company aims to reduce the fashion industries reliance on synthetic fibers that create large amounts of waste. Alexander and Daniel highlighted that the first lady of Finland wearing the fabric was a good step as people want their fashion to make them look and feel good and want to emulate famous people. Ashley brought up recycling old clothing as another way to reduce impact.</p>
