                <p>Name: Timothy Barbara</p>
                <p>eLearning Pack ID: IE-655-Spring 2-19-14-02</p>
                <p>Virtual Company Name: Titan International Manufacturing</p>
                <p>Titan International Manufacturing's goal is to create environmentally friendly, smart, and sustainable washing machines and driers for home use. Every day millions of Americans wash their laundry in so-called "dumb washing machines" that are old, outdated, energy inefficient, and lack the capabilities to filter harmful laundry byproducts like microplastics from entering the environment. Our smart washer will feature an intuitive interface and internet capabilities all with the goal of reducing waste.</p>

                <h2>Collaborating Companies:</h2>
                <h3>Tosei America Inc:</h3>
                <p>Tosei America is a manufacturing company specializing in measuring equipment and small mechanical and electrical components. We are partnering with Tosei to leverage their expertise in manufacturing highly precise machinery for taking measurements. We will be co-developing technology with them to measure the amount of plastic debris captured by our machines. We are confident Tosei can provide this to us.</p>
                <h3>WAGO:</h3>
                <p>WAGO is a manufacturer of electrical components ranging from simple wires and connectors to industrial and maratime control systems. From the ground up our manufacturing process needs to be green and the best way to achieve that is through a high degree of reliable automation. As sophisticated automated machines themselves our smart washing machines will require many electrical control components as well.</p>
                <h3>MPAL:</h3>
                <p>MPAL is a manufacturer specializing in the creation of custom tools and machining for various applications. We will use them to design some of the more specialized machines that we will be using to assemble the washing machines. An efficient washing machine requires many sensitive components that must be manufactured to a high degree of quality.</p>
                <h3>Modern Machine Shop:</h3>
                <p>Modern Machine Shop is a media brand which reports on the American CNC and metalworking industries. They also produce and maintain multimedia resources for researching processes related to machining and metalworking and for locating suppliers of equipment and services. We will be using their services to help build our manufacturing facility and train our workers.</p>

                <h2>Our Strategic Plan:</h2>
                <p>Environmental sustainability sits at the forefront of our corporate vision. The environmental impact of waste plastic on our environment and our oceans in particular is well documented and a very serious problem for mankind. One lesser known areas of this problem is the scorge of microplastics, small barely visible pieces of plastic that make their way into waterways and are consumed by animals. By some estimates there are between 93,000 and 236,000 metric tons of microplastic in the worlds oceans.</p>
                <p>A large part of this comes from synthetic clothing made from plastic fibers like acrylic and polyester. When clothes are washed they release tiny fibers which then make their way through the water treatment system and into the ecosystem. A series of smart washing machines have the potential to capture much of this plastic before it enters our waterways.</p>
                <p>Titan will employ concurrent engineering methods to create and market this new machine. Marketing must work closely with engineering to researcha and develop exactly what customers want in a new machine as well as work to educate customers on the dangers of microplastics and why our machines deliver a safer alternative. </p>

                <h2>Budgets:</h2>
                <p>Building - $10,000,000</p>
                <p>Manufacturing Equipment - $15,200,000</p>
                <p>Personnel - $1,000,000</p>
                <p>Benefits - $200,000</p>
                <p>Materials - $5,000,000</p>
                <p>R&D - $4,000,000</p>
                <p>Marketing - $60,000</p>
                <p>Sales - $1550,000</p>
                <p>Shipping - $500,000</p>
                <p>Maintenance - $100,000</p>
                <p>Administrative costs - $100,000</p>
    
                <h2>Metrics to Track:</h2>
                <h3>Average Unit Manufacturing Time:</h3>
                <p>We want to track how long from start to finish it takes to produce a smart washer. We want to be able to streamline our process and update inventory models to have materials ready in time.</p>
                <h3>Percentage of Recyclable Materials Used:</h3>
                <p>As a green company we want to source as many of our components as possible in a green and sustainable way. Using recycled material is one way to help us do that.</p>
                <h3>kWh per laundry cycle:</h3>
                <p>By reducing the energy usage of our washing machines use per cycle we can reduce our carbon footprint.</p>
                <h3>Percentage of microplastics captured per cycle:</h3>
                <p>The software in our washing machine needs to be able to effectively estimate how much microplastic is expected to be generated by the current load of laundry and compare this to the plastic captured by the filter. This will be the primary metric through which we improve our design.</p>
                <h3>Unit breakdown rate:</h3>
                <p>To gain acceptance from customers our machines must be highly reliable. We will track customer downtime and revise the machines as needed.</p>
    
                <h2>Management Objectives:</h2>
                <h3>Environmental Centric: </h3>
                <p>Our company must follow all legal requirements for environmental impact wherever we opperate but this alone is not enough. Our company should be viewed as an industry leader in sustainable design and manufacturing with the ultimate goal of a carbon neutral supply chain. All waste will be disposed of in a responsible manner.</p>
                <h3>Quality Engineering:</h3>
                <p>Our company must strive for quality in whatever we produce. We must aim to minimize customer down time and build a reputation for reliability.</p>
                <h3>Supplier Relationships:</h3>
                <p>We strive to work with suppliers who share our goals of environmentally sound practices. We should review the practices of our suppliers every quarter to ensure they align with our objectives.</p>
                <h3>Employee Engagement:</h3>
                <p>Our employees should feel that they are having an impact both at work and on society as a whole. Employees should be involved in key decisions processes and be given greater ownership of their own work.</p>

    
                <h2>Key Processes:</h2>
                <h3>Design Phase: </h3>
                <p>Before committing to any design changes we must perform feasibility studies including computer simulations. We must minimize waste generated during this process and avoid using physical paperwork where possible. We must conduct reviews of proposed changes without slowing down the design process considerably. By employing the latest in digital design we can reduce waste spent on implementing ideas and finding problems with them after completion.</p>
                <h3>Manufacturing: </h3>
                <p>Manufacturing should source components in a just in time manner to reduce space in the factory that must be dedicated to storage. All materials and waste must be accounted for at all times with nothing being allowed to leave the factory and enter the environment in an unplanned way. This is the most important area to reduce waste in for both economic and environmental reasons. From an economic standpoint wasting materials is wasting money, and any industrial accidents that contaminate the environment have the potential to open us up to fines or damage the prestige of the company.</p>
                <h3>Sales:</h3>
                <p>Our sales must be environmentally friendly employing best practices to reduce physical paperwork. Sales must also act as environmental stewards ensuring that our customers understand the value of our machines ability to filter microplastic and be able to pitch us as the environmental choice.</p>
                <h3>Distribution:</h3>
                <p>We must build a sustainable distribution network working closely with retailers and shippers to ensure that our product is delivered to the customer with minimal waste. We must also make sure that the customers old laundry machines are disposed of in a responsible way and recycled if possible.</p>
    
                <h2>Why We Must Act:</h2>
                <p>Synthetic fabrics such as acrylic and polyester make up more and more of the worlds wardrobe due to their cost and ease of manufacture. Synthetic fabrics allow mass produced clothing to be accessible to the masses. Unfortunately when these items are washed a significant number of fibers make their way into the water and subsequently into the oceans. </p>
                <p>Between the effects of climate change and human waste, our oceans are dying. Solid waste entering the worlds oceans is a major problem. The oceans are a very important resource for food and other natural resources that much of the worlds population relies on. It is estimated that between 93,000 and 236,000 metric tons of microplastics are in the worlds oceans. Plastic degrades very slowly over time which leads to a lot of this plastic being ingested by marine life and accumulated in the tissues of these creatures. In turn as these animals are consumed by other animals and humans, the cycle of microplastic contamination continues up the food chain. Once this plastic enters the ocean it is extremely difficult to clean up. </p>
                <p>Our approach is to try to reduce the number of clothing fibers that make their way into the environment through the use of smart washing machines that capture and filter microplastics from laundry before they leave the home. In addition, we expect our company to follow best practices for green manufacturing and sustainability to minimize our impact in other areas as we undertake this important mission. We must preserve our oceans for the betterment of future generations. Once only needs to look at the beautiful footage of pristine marine life to understand what we are fighting to protect. </p>

                <h2>Social Networking:</h2>
                <p>Article one was on Penn State researchers 3D printing large porous tissues. Ashley had done some research on tissue engineering so she found the article very interesting. She opened the discussion to more general advancements in bio implants. I then discussed a project of someone I know who is working on anti biotic coatings and her experience with the high rejection and infection rate for medical devices. I ended this discussion with a brief statement on how in the current legal landscape any company who could claim a reduction in infection would become the de facto standard due to lawyers getting involved and demanding to know why these innovative new products weren't used. Ashley then returned to the discussion of 3d printing from a cost savings perspective.</p>
                <p>Article two was on efforts to create environmentally friendly packaging. Ashley described her efforts to reduce her own waste due to concerns of pollution. I then brought up the issue of microplastics from clothing entering the ocean and remarked that perhaps the same bio plastics could be used in clothing. Ashley remarked that there would be difficulty in getting clothing manufactures to switch to more sustainable options and perhaps a social media awareness campaign could help. </p>
                <p>Article three was on Boeing finding a partner who could recycle aviation carbon fiber. I remarked that there are probably many industries dealing with waste problems that most people don't think about. Ashley remarked that it is good for companies to be responsible with waste and said that her company which produces medical implants remelts unused material to try again.</p>
