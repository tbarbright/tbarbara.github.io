                <h2>Video Questions:</h2>

                <h3>Video 1 An Introduction to PLM and Digital Manufacturing Using DELMIA PLM Methods and Solutions Part 1:</h3>

                <h4>What are the phases of digital manufacturing planning?</h4>

                <p>Conceptual planning includes assembly process planning where the entire process is planned using past knowledge and templates and 3D assembly process validation where the process is modeled and checked for problems.</p>

                <p>Resource planning and resource programing determines the physical setup of the assembly line and what resources will be used where. This includes line balancing and workstation definition which includes flow simulation, automated station simulation, and manual station simulation.</p>

                <p>Lastly execution puts the plan into action.</p>

                <h4>What is the benefit to using templates in the design process?</h4>

                <p>Templates describe how a certain part of the manufacturing process is usually done. They contain information on the typical process and parameters that must be considered. The benefit to this is that it allows the process planner to leverage past information in future plans and refine existing processes.</p>

                <h4>Why is digital manufacturing referees to as the glue between the product and the process? </h4>

                <p>Digital manufacturing relates a product to a process. Each step has a clear goal of creating some component of the product. The product or process can be refined based on this manufacturing plan.  </p>

                <h4>What is the difference between a process planner and a 3D process planner and how do they work together? </h4>

                <p>A process planner describes a process in software and creates a detailed plan on implementation. A 3D process planner takes this process plan and checks it for accuracy and other issues. The 3D planner then builds a model of this process in software. </p>

                <h4>Why is line balancing and workstation definition important? </h4>

                <p>Line balancing and workstation definition is important because it can help identify bottle necks in the process and help stimulate the flow of the product from one station to another. Placing closely related stations near one another can aid in the smooth transition of a product from one area to another. Having too many stations near each other can create space issues. Line balancing can also help ensure that one area of the factory isn’t overwhelmed while other areas go unused. </p>

                <h3>Video 2 An Introduction to PLM and Digital Manufacturing Using DELMIA PLM Methods and Solutions Part 2: </h3>

                <h4>What are some potential ways issues with the assembly process can be solved? </h4>

                <p>Design issues can be handled in multiple ways. We could change the design to accommodate the existing assembly process. We could also choose to find a different way to assemble the product. </p>

                <h4>What is an engineering change request and why are they used? </h4>

                <p>Engineering change requests are used to track changes in design. Tickets are opened to be reviewed by other team members. It is beneficial to use these tickets over simple email because the changes and discussions can all be tracked in one place. Changes can be traced back to individual tickets for greater accountability. </p>

                <h4>How does digital design software like Enovia help aid design reviews? </h4>

                <p>Software enables easier collaboration as multiple users can work on the same file from different workstations. This means that teams do not have to be located in the same office to collaborate on a project. Using standardized software can allow people of different backgrounds and disciplines to work together. </p>

                <h4>What are some benefits of the DELMIA Digital Factory?</h4>

                <p>Design and engineering are linked together which can shorten development time. Process engineering time can be shortened. Designs can be seamlessly transitioned from digital models into production. </p>

                <h4>How can 3D modeling software help attract young engineers?</h4>

                <p>3D modeling allows visual learners to truly understand a process. When you can easily see what is happening on screen it is easier to visualize the final product. 3D modeling can also appeal to players of video games as building these models can be fun. </p>

                <h3>Video 3 Intelligent Enterprise Design:</h3>

                <h4>What were the time benefits for Rolls Royce Aerospace of moving from physical models to virtual ones? </h4>

                <p>Due to the extremely large number of parts involved in an aircraft, digital methods were hugely beneficial. Compressing the time taken to make a new aircraft was another benefit. It used to take 15-20 years to develop a new aircraft but thanks to digital design this was reduced to around 4 years. </p>

                <h4>Why did joint ventures become popular with aerospace companies? </h4>

                <p>Aerospace companies are very aware of the global economy. Many aviation projects will not see revenue for many years down the road. Combining resources for joint products is one way to help spread this cost around. Additionally, work packages can be divided up to companies more experienced in each area. </p>
                
                <h4>How did the move to virtual design of engines enable engineers to travel less?</h4>

                <p>When physical models were used to build engines, engineers had to physically travel to the location of the model and bring materials to fit parts. If things didn’t work they had to return home and come back with different parts. This was a huge expense. </p>

                <h4>Why were older engineers resistant to digital pre-assembly?</h4>

                <p>Humans are naturally conservative and resistant to change. The engineers who were used to the old ways of doing things found they preferred collaborating with co-workers in person. Standing next to somebody and sharing a drawing board helped solve problems. Additionally there was a camaraderie among engineers who shared working space. It was more natural for engineers to think of manufacturing in a manufacturing space rather than a design space. </p>

                <h4>What are silos and what problems do silos have?</h4>

                <p>Silos refer to information and processes and that are very vertically oriented with key decision makers at the top. A silo is typically focused on one task. The problem with silos is that there is a limited exchange of information between teams and therefore it is more difficult to plan overall enterprise goals. </p>

                <h3>Video 4 Collaborative Product/Process Development in a Global World:</h3>

                <h4>Why is it important to have collaborative development teams around the world from a cultural standpoint? </h4>

                <p>Different needs from different cultures drive product designs. Take cars for example, what’s considered a mid-size car in the United States may be considered a full size car in Europe. Therefore it is important to have designers from different parts of the world collaborate to customize products for a particular market. The goal is for any consumer around the globe to feel like their product was designed for them alone. </p>

                <h3>What is globalization? </h3>

                <p>Globalization is the idea that an enterprise extends beyond national boarders and into a global market. A product may be designed in France, manufactured in China, and sold in Canada all by the same global company. Advances in technology have made it easier and quicker to complete the international transactions. Globalization should support a better life for everyone. </p>

                <h4>Why is globalization as irreversible and inevitable?  </h4>

                <p>With the rise of modern technology such as the internet people are more connected than ever. Knowledge is spreading at an incredible rate across national boundaries.  Air travel makes it much easier for many people to travel the globe for work and leisure exposing them to other cultures. </p>

                <h4>How can an enterprise promote ethical win-win free trade? </h4>

                <p>Companies can offer unrestricted access to markets for exports from poor countries and do so without jeopardizing critical jobs back home. They can encourage the flow of capital to these countries and supplement rapid debt relief. The can also analyze the needs of these markets and offer expertise in solving them. </p>

                <h4>What are the boundaries of TQM in emerging markets?</h4>

                <p>Companies must be realistic in what they can expect. Although new ideas have a lot of potential some countries may not yet understand that or are not ready. The business needs to ensure they are trying to fit the culture of the country they operate in. </p>

                <h3>Video 5 Digital Product Design: Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and Assembly (DFA) Principals and Practical Product Design Examples</h3>

                <h4>Why is it advantageous to use digital design to produce parts with a single piece? </h4>

                <p>Producing parts in one piece reduces complexity by eliminating assembly steps. Single pieces cut with CNC machines can also have much tighter tolerances and be built stronger. This also makes maintenance easier because there are fewer parts to keep in stock. </p>

                <h4>Why is it important for designers to be experts in the assembly process? </h4>

                <p>Advanced machines such a mill turn machines can produce very complex designs as a single part. It is important for a designer to be familiar with the sorts of processes available to manufacturing. The designer can write the exact steps the machine needs to perform to complete the design. </p>

                <h4>What are the benefits to complex machines such as mill turn machines?</h4> 

                <p>Mill turn machines can create complex parts by performing multiple operations on a single part. In the past, such complex shapes would require multiple machines to produce which increases complexity. Reducing the number of machines one needs to purchase can also keep costs down. </p>

                <h4>What steps can be taken to reduce the number of parts needed for a design?</h4>

                <p>We can eliminate parts or integrate the functions of that part into another part. We should also consider if we really need the part in the first place. </p>
                
                <h4>What is Z-Stacking and how can it help reduce complexity?</h4>

                <p>Z-Stacking is designing a product to be assembled in a single orientation. The less we need to rotate and move a product during assembly the simpler or assembly line can be. Each rotation or turn adds another step and potentially another machine to the assembly process. </p>

                <h3>Video 6 CNC Machine and Robot Integrated Cells and Flexible Agile Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems</h3>

                <h4>What is a CNC machine? </h4>

                <p>CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control. It is a manufacturing process that uses computers to control machines such as lathes, mills, routers, and grinders. CNC machines are used to automate the production of complex parts. </p>

                <h4>What are axises of control and why are they important? </h4>

                <p>An axis of control refers to a direction in which a machine is able to move. Many machines feature only two axises X and Y which allows for horizontal and vertical movement. More complex machines also employ a Z axis for movement up and down. These axises allow more complex and exotic parts to be produced. </p>

                <h4>What are chips or swarf and why must they be dealt with? </h4>

                <p>Chips are small pieces of material that are the remains of material removed from a metal blank during the milling process. If left in the machine they can get caught in the cutting tools and damage them or the product being produced. This leads to wasted time and materials. </p>

                <h4>How does a large tool magazine help the CNC machine?</h4>

                <p>A tool magazine can be used to rapidly and automatically change the tool that a particular machine is making. This allows for greater flexibility in designs. A single machine is able to perform more steps in rapid succession using this method. This also allows the use of “sister tools” or multiple tools of the same type that can be used if we are wearing out tools too fast.  </p>

                <h4>What is a pallet and why are they used?</h4>

                <p>A pallet is a standardized holding system for CNC machines that can be used to transport products between machines. Pallet changers can be manual or automatically operated. This allows products to be easily moved from one machine to another with minimal intervention or to allow products to cool between machining. </p>

                <h3>Video 7 Digital Product Design: Design for Quality Principals, and Practical Product Design Examples: </h3>

                <h4>What is quality? </h4>

                <p>Quality means fitness for use. Customers must be satisfied by a quality product to keep them coming back to your business. Quality is everybody’s responsibility and must be provided to reduce costs. </p>

                <h4>Why are aesthetics important?</h4>

                <p>Aesthetics are an important part of quality. People perceive an aesthetically pleasing object to be of higher quality than an ugly one. Thinking about aesthetics shows customers that you care about the product. Aesthetics are also very subjective so designing different products can appeal to different groups of people. </p>

                <h4>What is the problem with traditional quality management?</h4>

                <p>Traditional quality management focuses on correcting mistakes that have been made rather than preventing mistakes. This approach does not address why mistakes were made and allows them to continue. Accountants view this as an expensive add on item rather than an integral part of the process. </p>

                <h4>Why might quality definitions vary in different regions of the world?</h4>

                <p>Different regions of the world have different standards of quality. For example one country might have different standards for things like lead paint. One country may require more durable items as servicing them is more difficult. Different cultures may have different expectations for quality.</p>

                <h4>What is the cost of change and how can it be reduced? </h4>

                <p>The cost of change refers to how much money it costs to make changes at different points in the design and manufacturing process. Typically changes get exponentially more expensive the further along in the design process we are. The cost of change can be reduced by designing quality into the product in such a way to minimize changes. </p>

                <h3>Video 8 Toyota Industrial Equipment Innovation: Lift Truck Engineering Design Challenges and Solutions. </h3>

                <h4>What are some ergonomic considerations that were made in the design of Toyota’s forklift? </h4>

                <p>Toyota made the seat more comfortable that its competitors designs. They also increased the size of the footwell to accommodate work-boots and the size of the handles to accommodate gloves. They also made the dashboard as low as possible so that the worker could see the fork tips to aid in loading without leaning forward and causing backstrain. The parking brake is placed in the footwell for its easier to reach and lift controls are within easy reach of the driver. The seat swivels for backwards driving and the rear handle features a horn button. </p>

                <h4>How does Toyota’s design focus on safety?</h4>

                <p>Toyota’s forklift features an active stability control system to prevent rollover accidents. The system is designed in such a way that it should not interfere with normal work operation. The truck is also designed to maximize visibility with handles angled inwards to fit behind the vehicle frame. </p>

                <h4>How did Toyota use data to drive development of active safety systems? </h4>

                <p>Toyota gathered data on forklift accidents and discovered that tip over accidents were the most common deadly accident. They designed their forklift with rollover prevention as an important requirement. Since the system was implemented in 1999 Toyota continued to track accident data and refined the system in response to that data. They have not had a fatal rollover accident due to a problem with the truck since then. </p>

                <h4>What is Kaizen process and how does Toyota employ it in its forklift design? </h4>

                <p>Kaizen is a Japanese word meaning continuous change for the better. One example of the Kaizen process is the design of the lifting fork itself. Toyota has worked continuously to make the forks more visible from lowering the dashboard to moving the posts and they expect the visibility to get better as the process improves. </p>

                <h4>Why is customer feedback important to Toyota? </h4>

                <p>To an operator, a forklift is their office where they spend 8 hours a day. They are the experts in what they want and need from a forklift. Operators can make requests like larger cup holders or more computer monitoring that will make their lives easier and therefore make them more likely to buy Toyota forklifts. </p>

                <h3>Video 9 Product Distribution & Supply Chain Management: Industrial RFID Smart Label Printing and Marking Engineering Design Challenges and Solutions</h3>

                <h4>What advantages do RFID tags have to traditional barcodes? </h4>

                <p>RFID tags can be more easily read and tracked as they pass through locations. The scanner does not need to come into physical contact with them. Some large retailers require RFID tags as they have too much product to scan individually. </p>

                <h4>How are the RFID tags encoded?</h4>

                <p>The RFID tags come in a roll all with the same serial number. The printing device encodes the tag with a unique number in hexadecimal format. This allows a lot of data to be stored on the tag.</p>

                <h4>What may happen if a bad RFID tag is placed on a product label?</h4>

                <p>A bad RFID tag could result in customer products getting lost. If the machine is unable to read the tag product can be sent to the wrong location or not logged as it leaves the facility. The customer can get more or less product than they paid for. This would be unacceptable. </p>

                <h4>What steps does Weber take to ensure quality in its RFID tags? </h4>

                <p>Weber inspects each RFID tag it receives and removes the bad ones before they are shipped to customers. The machine which installs the tags then inspects them again before use and rejects bad tags by sticking them to a plate to be inspected later. </p>

                <h4>How does Weber fulfill the needs of customers who are not ready to use RFID?</h4>

                <p>Weber’s labeling machines are all RFID ready. A customer may purchase a regular label printer which can have RFID added it it later. This allows multiple types of customers to be served by a single machine. </p>

                <h3>Video 10 Engineering Design Reviews Part 1: Automotive Examples </h3>

                <h4>What are the benefits of Toyota’s Hydrogen car? What are some drawbacks? </h4>

                <p>The hydrogen fuel cells produce only water as a byproduct. There are no emissions. A hydrogen platform is very scalable and can be used to a number of different types of vehicles. Also a hydrogen car can be refueled in just a few minutes instead of several hours. Unfortunately the infrastructure still will need time to be put into place. </p>

                <h4>What makes the Toyota RAV4 an attractive vehicle to consumers? </h4>

                <p>The Toyota RAV4 was designed for families who want a practical small SUV. The form factor makes it a great vehicle for carrying people and cargo. The advanced all wheel drive system was designed to save fuel and offer increased capability. The hybrid model offers great fuel economy. Toyota also focused on safety for the RAV4. </p>

                <h4>How does Toyota balance the small cars and SUVs? </h4>

                <p>According to Toyota within the next few years up to 70% of new car sales will be SUVs. Toyota has introduced several models to take those buyers. However unlike other manufactures who are pulling out of car sales Toyota remains dedicated. Even though only 30% of the market is cars Toyota wants to capture as much of that market as they can. As their competitors leave it gives them more of a chance to step in. </p>

                <h4>What the benefit of using a platform such as the TNGA platform? </h4>

                <p>The platform was designed to be versatile. It has been used for conventional gas and hybrid vehicles with a possible electric vehicle in mind. By designing the vehicle this way Toyota can reduce manufacturing complexity by sharing parts between cars. </p>

                <h4>What are the benefits to not being first with regard to cutting edge technology such as self driving cars? </h4>

                <p>Self driving car technology is still in its infancy. Many manufacturers are racing to be first to bring a self driving car to market but many consumers are still not sure of the new technology. Rather than rush out an untested product Toyota takes the stance that it wants to wait until it can provide customers with a sure thing that is as safe as it can be. </p>

                <h3>Video 11 Palawan El Nido Highlights:</h3>

                <h4>How does the El Nido resort strive to be sustainable and green? </h4>

                <p>The El Nido resort in the Philippines strives to be the Philippines’ greenest resort. To accomplish this they have a number of initiatives in place such as their state of the art sewage and recycling facilities. Their desalination plant allows the resort to be self sustaining without relying on mainland water supplies being transported in. Guest rooms are fitted with high efficiency light bulbs with non-essential lights scheduled to shut down at certain times to conserve energy. The resort also strives to provide guests low environmental impact activities. </p>

                <h4>What sorts of nature conservation does El Nido Resort perform? </h4>

                <p>El Nido participates in conservation efforts such as protection of endangered species like sea turtles. El Nido also works with local conservation groups on projects such as the creation of new artificial reefs. They also support scientific studies on flora and fauna. </p>

                <h4>What are the five green tenets of El Nido Resort? </h4>

                <p>Linking with local communities through employment and purchases.</p>
                <p>Nurturing a culture of environmental stewardship.</p>
                <p>Initiating opportunities for guests to experience nature and the local culture</p>
                <p>Discovering and molding sustainability champions among the staff</p>
                <p>Outdoing ourselves every year by building new sustainability programs on the success of previous ones</p>

                <h4>What sorts of threats are faced by our marine ecosystems? </h4>

                <p>Rising sea temperatures as a result of climate change are causing dramatic changes for sea life. Many species are dying as a result. Coral bleaching as a result of rising temperatures and pollution has led to the loss of many marine habitats. Additionally the rise of microplastics in our ocean has contributed greatly to overall pollution levels. Unauthorized fishing and overfishing have greatly depleted the natural resources available to many communities and caused great economic impact. </p>

                <h4>Why is it important for resorts such as El Nido to practice sustainable green engineering? </h4>

                <p>The local economies of many tropical locations depend on nature to survive. Conservation efforts can help prevent overfishing which can prevent strain on the local population from lack of food. Preserving pristine natural habitats can also promote tourism which can bring in more money to the local economy. </p>

                <h2>Questions and Answers: </h2>


                <h3>What is CE and PLM?</h3>

                <p>CE stands for concurrent engineering. It is a work methodology which focuses on the parallelization of tasks. The idea behind concurrent engineering is that working in parallel provides for greater understanding of the customer needs by all involved teams that must work closer together and also allows the final product to be delivered sooner. From a quality perspective, a concurrent design allows business to more quickly adapt to change and fix problems with a product. Concurrent engineering allows teams to identify problems sooner before they become major expensive issues requiring a redesign. </p>

                <p>PLM or Product life-cycle management is the process of managing a product from its conception to design, implementation, usage, and eventual disposal. PLM defines a process for an enterprise to follow when developing a product and allows for the easy flow of information. PLM includes elements of Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), and Product Data Management (PDM.) </p>

                <h3>What is the difference between Concurrent Engineering (CE) and Product Life-Cycle Management (PLM)? </h3>

                <p>Concurrent Engineering is a process which is concerned with performing tasks in parallel to complete a project faster and reducing waste by increasing collaboration. Product Life-cycle Management tracks the specific stages of a product’s life and establishes methods for efficiently dealing with each step. PLM is more focused on specific systems. </p>

                <h3>What is green sustainable PLM? </h3>

                <p>Green sustainable PLM takes into account a product’s impact on the environment and aims to reduce this impact. For example a company may strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their factories by using green energy. As PLM also deals with the death of products green sustainable PLM approach must consider what impact a product will have when thrown away. For example, a manufacturer may opt to use a more expensive but more recyclable material when building a product in order to reduce waste.</p>

                <h3>What is digital design & manufacture and why is this such a huge opportunity?</h3>

                <p>Digital design and manufacturing involves the usage of computer simulation and other software to aid in the design and manufacturing process for a product. This is a huge opportunity because it allows companies to design products virtually before committing any more money or resources to a physical product. This can help reduce waste because problems with designs can be identified before material is wasted and designs can be refined more quickly. For example, an auto manufacturer will build a virtual model of a car in order to judge aerodynamics before conducting an actual wind tunnel test. </p>

                <h3>How is digital design integrated with digital manufacturing in PLM?</h3>

                <p>Products should be designed for manufacturing (DFM). As a general rule, products should be designed to minimize the number of stages involved in the manufacturing process. When a product is designed digitally it can be then loaded into another program which can simulate a manufacturing setup. The digital design and digital manufacturing system can be fine tuned together before being put into production. </p>

                <h3>What is frontloading, and why is it critical to understand this process?</h3>

                <p>Frontloading is the act of building a substantial knowledge base using a cross functional team at the beginning of a design process. It is critical to have a well defined product and discuss potential issues as early as possible because changes become exponentially more expensive to make the further along in the process a project gets. If these issues are discovered early in the planning or digital design process they are much easier to fix than later on the factory floor.</p>

                <h2>Chapter Questions: </h2>

                <h3>Chapter 1: </h3>

                <h4>What is TQM in the product, process, service system design context? </h4>

                <p>TQM or total quality management is a business approach focused on high quality. For products, this means a product which reaches the end user with no defects. In order to achieve this, the whole process must focus on quality. This means the best engineers working with the best tools. In TQM quality must be everyones responsibility and everyone must strive to eliminate waste. Quality helps build a companies reputation so servicing and maintaining products in the field is also important. </p>

                <h4>How would you assure, that your designers, employees create 'quality product', 'quality process', 'quality service’?</h4>

                <p>Everyone should be responsible for quality at all levels from design to completion. Coming from a QA background I understand the importance of quality. In addition to product managers collecting customer requirements, input on designs must come from the people who will be building the product, the people who will be testing the product, and the people who will be servicing the product. Each side must be given consideration. For example, an engineer may want to design a product in a way that’s quick and easy for them but perhaps this design is more difficult to test or service in the field. </p>

                <h4>Why is it important to create and offer 'quality product', 'quality process', 'quality service’?</h4>

                <p>In business, your quality is your reputation. A low priced product may draw customers in, but a quality product will keep customers coming back. In a highly competitive industry customers may not be willing to deal with frequent quality issues and may be driven to your competitor. Additionally, time and money spent fixing defective products could have been saved up front by investing in a quality process. </p>

                <h4>List, and explain the various dimensions of design quality, with examples.</h4>

                <p>Brand name quality refers to what customers expect from your brand. What is your companies reputation? For example, a high end brand like Rolls Royce is synonymous with luxury and quality. </p>
                <p>Features refers to the features of your product and how those features compare the competing products. For example, cell phone manufactures will often tout the specs of their new integrated cameras while various blogs will compare these cameras to other phones. </p>
                <p>Performance refers to a product meeting or exceeding expectations. For example buyers of a high end sports car like Lamborghini or Ferrari expect a high performance car in regards to speed and handling. </p>
                <p>Reliability refers to how often a product fails to perform. For example many cheap power tools from China are known to have issues with longevity which could negate the savings from purchasing the cheaper tool. </p>
                <p>Serviceability refers to how easy a product is to service. For example many modern ultrabook style laptops are not easily disassembled and serviced by end users. Many IT departments which need to perform maintenance on equipment may prefer desktops or mobile workstation style laptops for this reason. </p>
                <p>Aesthetics refers to how good a product looks. Apple for example strives to make all of its products very minimalist looking and attempts to create a uniform product line that conveys a single brand image. </p>
                <p>Excitement quality refers to how exciting a product is. For example a Ford Mustang may be perceived as a higher quality car than a Ford Focus because the Mustang just looks and feels more exciting. </p>
                <p>Safety quality refers to how safe the product is. For example a modern car with various safety features such as seatbelts and airbags is much safer than an older car and therefore may be seen as higher quality. </p>
                <p>Conformance to eco standards refers to how environmentally friendly a product is. For example a product can be made or recyclable materials to help reduce its carbon footprint. </p>

                <h4>Why is sustainable green and eco-friendliness important for the design team?</h4>

                <p>In the long term, sustainable green design will save the company money on energy and waste disposal costs as well as eliminate some waste altogether. In addition, with the modern realities of climate change every company must do their part in order to reduce our impact on the planet. As damage to the environment increases companies may find themselves spending even more money trying to undo the damage that could have been prevented. </p>


                <h3>Chapter 2: </h3>

                <h4>Organizations depend on their customers, and therefore should understand their current and future needs, as well as should meet customer requirements, and strive to exceed customer expectations. What does this quality principle mean, and how could you implement it?</h4>

                <p>Understanding customer needs is the cornerstone of any successful product. Being able to deliver what a customer wants will make the customer happy, which means they’ll be more likely to return to you in the future. Delivering what the customer wants means understanding the customer’s business and their requirements. Capable sales people and product managers should serve as a bridge between engineering teams and customers with their ability to take customer requests and turn them into concrete requirements. Customer feedback is very important in this area as you want to make sure that what is being delivered is what was asked for. </p>

                <h4>Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction of the organization. They should create and maintain the internal environment in which people can become fully involved in achieving the organization's objectives. What does this quality principle mean, and how could you implement it? What are the key characteristics of quality leaders?</h4>

                <p>Quality leadership establishes the purpose of an organization. A good leader sees the big picture and is able to balance service, cost, and customer need and explain these elements to their subordinates. In order to build this picture a good leader must work to align activities in the organization to promote synergy and minimize communication breakdowns. The ideas of all involved in the project must be considered from internal teams to society as a whole. The future of the organization must be clear and challenging goals must be set. Trust must be established between managers and subordinates. </p>

                <h4>People (or in other words, 'knowledge workers') at all levels are the essence of an organization and their full involvement enables their abilities to be used for the organization's benefit. What does this quality principle mean, and how could you implement it? What are the key characteristics of quality 'knowledge workers'? How can a 'knowledge worker' improve his / her quality attributes? Why should he / she do so?</h4>

                <p>A good worker is motivated, committed and involved and understands CE and PLM. Good workers must be innovative and creative in expanding the organization's objectives. Good employees are accountable for their own performances and how they can improve. They should be eager to participate and understand the importance of this participation and how it contributes to the organization. Lastly employees should not be afraid to speak up and identify problems. </p>

                <h4>Effective decisions are based on the analysis of data and information. (Information is data about data). What does this quality principle mean, and how could you implement it? How can we assure that our data, and therefore our information is accurate? What happens when major decisions are taken based on faulty data? What are the consequences for the organization, the entire system, and the society on a global basis? (Give examples!)</h4>

                <p>Collecting and analyzing data is a very important part of quality. Data must come from trusted sources and be verified and checked for correctness by responsible auditors. One infamous example of bad data making its way into decision making is the 2001 Enron scandal. Enron’s top executives deliberately falsified financial data provided to investors and regulators. Enron’s auditors, Arthur Anderson, were complicit in the scheme and attempted to hide the bad data they were supposed to be reporting on. The end result was the total collapse of both Enron, one of one of the largest companies in the world, and Arthur Anderson one of the big 5 accounting firms. Many employees lost pensions and savings while investors lost $11 billion dollars. Congressional hearings were held and ultimately the Sarbanes-Oxley act was passed holding business to higher standards with regards to record keeping. </p>

                <h4>The continual improvement of the organization's overall performance should be a permanent objective of the organization. What does this quality principle mean, and how could you implement it?</h4>

                <p>An organization must always be trying to do better. Stagnation leads to the eventual death of many companies like in the cases of Yahoo! or Kodak. Everyone should have a stake in the organizations success. Realistic but challenging goals should be set and employees should be incentivized to hit them. Revenue sharing through stock options or bonuses could be a useful tool in this regard. </p>


                <h3>Chapter 3: </h3>

                <h4>What is MUDA and why should it be avoided? </h4>

                <p>MUDA is a Japanese word meaning waste. To the Japanese this includes any product functions which add no value, additional parts which are unnecessary, parts which are too complicated to produce or feature unnecessarily tight tolerances, parts which cost too much or are wasteful, and parts which are derived from toxic material. In order to avoid waste and improve quality these should be kept to a minimum. </p>

                <h4>Why should the number of parts in a design be minimized? </h4>

                <p>Products with fewer parts will cost less to produce. Manufacturers will also be able to reduce space used for parts storage. Simpler products are also easier to produce and easier to repair and can therefore be made higher quality. </p>

                <h4>What are ergonomics and why are they important? </h4>

                <p>Ergonomics is the science of designing items to fit the worker. Ergonomics can help an end user better enjoy a product and make it safer for use. Ergonomics can help prevent repetitive strain injuries which can lead to long term issues.</p>

                <h4>What are the hallmarks of a good industrial design?</h4>

                <p>A good industrial design optimizes the balance between function, value, and appearance. A good design should be sustainable and ergonomic and pleasing to use. The needs of users need to be taken into consideration. </p>

                <h4>What are the areas of focus for usability? </h4>

                <p>Usability is about making a product more useful. A useful product is more efficient, in that it makes a previously tedious task easier. A useful product is easy to learn and does not make the process it helps more complicated to learn. A useful product is satisfying to use than the old methods. </p>
                
                <h2>Social Networking:</h2>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=333610>Article one</a> was on Barry Callebaut announcing that 44% of its Cocoa bean supply chain is sustainably sourced. The goals of the chocolate maker were to lift farmers out of poverty, eradicate child labor, become carbon neutral and forest positive, and have 100% sustainable ingredients. Rohit raised the point that many companies are reluctant to take up these sorts of initiatives and then asked the question of if sustainability initiatives could have other benefits. I then talked about how companies like Nestle were facing bad press from their failure to take up these sorts of initiatives so companies could risk bad PR by not following sustainable practices.</p>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=333613>Article two</a> was on the development of next generation intelligence and concerns that the United States was falling behind. Rohit raised the problem that one current problem with second gen AI is bad data sets that can break the AI. He asked what AI we have been exposed to. I spoke of the tech industry and specifically Microsoft and their failed AI Tay. Tay was fed thousands of racist and anti-Semitic comments by trolls and as a result because essentially a white supremacist within a few hours. Microsoft's second attempt, Zo, aggressively filtered political and religious content to the point where the bot became standoffish at even the slightest mention of certain topics. Anthony pointed out that AI is also being used in construction to process incredible amounts of data such as with smart lights, BIM design, and drone surveying. </p>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=333614>Article three</a> was on loyalty programs and how many companies are derivative and don't over enough value. Rohit said that many managers are afraid to go crazy with these programs because it creates an uneven user experience. I stated that in many cases loyalty programs offer no real benefit and offered my experience of pushing lackluster loyalty programs at Toys R Us. Pushing a bad loyalty program can affect customer satisfaction and have a negative impact on business. Anthony then brought up the idea of stores using loyalty programs to create an experience rather than just a generic coupon program.</p>
