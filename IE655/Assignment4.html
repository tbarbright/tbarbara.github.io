                <p>Virtual Company Name: Titan International Manufacturing</p>

                <p>Titan International Manufacturing's goal is to create environmentally friendly, smart, and sustainable washing machines and driers for home use. Every day millions of Americans wash their laundry in so-called "dumb washing machines" that are old, outdated, energy inefficient, and lack the capabilities to filter harmful laundry byproducts like microplastics from entering the environment. Our smart washer will feature an intuitive interface and internet capabilities all with the goal of reducing waste.</p>

                <h2>Collaborating Companies:</h2>
                <h3>Tosei America Inc:</h3>
                <p>Tosei America is a manufacturing company specializing in measuring equipment and small mechanical and electrical components. We are partnering with Tosei to leverage their expertise in manufacturing highly precise machinery for taking measurements. We will be co-developing technology with them to measure the amount of plastic debris captured by our machines. We are confident Tosei can provide this to us.</p>
                <h3>WAGO:</h3>
                <p>WAGO is a manufacturer of electrical components ranging from simple wires and connectors to industrial and maratime control systems. From the ground up our manufacturing process needs to be green and the best way to achieve that is through a high degree of reliable automation. As sophisticated automated machines themselves our smart washing machines will require many electrical control components as well.</p>
                <h3>MPAL:</h3>
                <p>MPAL is a manufacturer specializing in the creation of custom tools and machining for various applications. We will use them to design some of the more specialized machines that we will be using to assemble the washing machines. An efficient washing machine requires many sensitive components that must be manufactured to a high degree of quality.</p>
                <h3>Modern Machine Shop:</h3>
                <p>Modern Machine Shop is a media brand which reports on the American CNC and metalworking industries. They also produce and maintain multimedia resources for researching processes related to machining and metalworking and for locating suppliers of equipment and services. We will be using their services to help build our manufacturing facility and train our workers.</p>

                <h2>Methods Applied: </h2>

                <p>Our green manufacturing plan includes several key elements that will ensure that Titan’s Smartwash will be the greenest washing machine on the market from inception to operation. </p>

                <p>We will be applying state of the art methods such as computer numerical control, design for manufacture, modular design and product structure, and design for ease of fabrication. </p>

                <p>Using CNC machines we can automate the creation of various metal components that will be used to make the washing machines. This will allow us to create the basic structure of our machines using fewer parts. Designing for minimum parts is a goal of this venture. We will be working closely with Tosei and MPAL in this project. This will be a part our Six-Sigma process where we strive for zero defects. </p>

                <p>Unlike a typical machine which requires specialized training and equipment to service our washing machine is designed to be highly user friendly both inside and out. The use of interchangeable modular components and easily accessible interior spaces will allow customers the opportunity to swap out and upgrade components as time goes on. the Smartwash line will include a base machine with the basic features one could expect in a washing machine will all of the plastic catching filters pre-installed. From there we will offer a number of “modules” that the user can install in the machine to provide new functionality. These modules will allow users to future proof their machine and upgrade to the newest models without the need to discard their old machines. This will lead to a significant reduction in waste and make recycling easier. </p>

                <p>Each machine will be put through rigorous tests at a final inspection station to ensure that every smart-wash meets our highest standards. If for whatever reason a machine breaks down in the field our trained technicians will be dispatched to deal with the problem. The technician will prepare a report on what happened and we will use this information as part Kaisen process. Each problem in the field has a root cause at manufacturing. If we can identify these issues quickly we can refine the process as needed. Modern Machine Shop will provide this training. </p>

                <p>We will also seek to reduce our impact on the environment by making sure our buildings from manufacture to offices are all LEED Platinum certified. This will ensure that we are using all of the industries best practices to reduce our impact on the environment and save money. WAGO will help us ensure our facilities meet the highest standards. </p>

                <h2>Questions:</h2>

                <h3>What does the classical school say about what makes a good manager? </h3>

                <p>A good manager in the classical school sets up the design system, delegates work to subordinates, sets a standard of performance by setting unambiguous goals, creates production targets, rates employees objectively, and eliminates poor performance through education or replacement. </p>

                <h3>What are the problems with classical management according to Deming? </h3>

                <p>Classical organizations care only about survival and profit rather than making high quality goods. A good manager according to Deming must provide the best goods and services at the lowest cost. Everyone, not just the manager, is responsible for quality. In this way managers create lower costs and higher quality while improving relationships between employees. </p>

                <h3>What is Poka-Yoke? </h3>

                <p>Poka-Yoke is a technique for avoiding human error and avoiding defects at all levels of work. The idea of Poka-Yoke is that the knowledge of the people who work on and build the product is just as important as the engineers who design the product. A good designer must understand the manufacturing process. Poka-Yoke emphasizes that all products must be inspected. Not just a sampling. This is accomplished through source inspection, or making sure defective materials don’t enter the line, 100% inspection where defects are avoided by constantly inspecting the process, and stopping the process if there are any errors.  </p>

                <h3>What are different types of human error? </h3>

                <p>Errors due to a misunderstanding, errors made due to absentmindedness, errors due to forgetfulness, errors made in identification, errors due to tiredness or slowness, errors due to a lack of standards, panic and surprise errors, errors due to the lack of experience or training, and deliberate errors.</p>

                <h3>What are the benefits of design for a minimum number of parts? </h3>

                <p>Designing products with fewer parts results in lesser inventory holding costs as less space is needed to store parts. There is also less work in progress related storage. Manufacturing and assembly is simplified reducing cost there as well. Less parts also mean easier maintenance, testing, and easier recycling. </p>

                <h3>What are the concepts of Kaisen and Kanri and how are they related?  </h3>

                <p>Kaisen means continuous improvement. It is the idea that a development process should constantly improve which will lead to reduced costs, improved quality, and efficiency. This is accomplished through small permanent improvements. Kanri is the means by which improvements can be accomplished. It is a multi step process. The first step is plan, where we decide what we will do based on given data. Second is doing where we carry out that plan in an appropriate way. We then check the results of the action to see if we have gotten our desired outcome. Lastly we act, or take what we have learned from the improvements and try to identify how we can improve further. </p>

                <h3>What are quality circles and what do they help achieve? </h3>

                <p>Quality circles are activities in which people get together and try to solve problems. They are intended to provide a relaxed environment in which people can openly talk about solutions. They are focused on self development so everyone can learn about the process. It should not be a forced activity but participation by all is important. </p>

                <h3>What are MUDA, MURA, and MURI and why should the be avoided? </h3>

                <p>MUDA means waste. It can include wasted materials, unbalanced workloads, long waiting times, and poor coordination. It should be avoided as it costs the company time and money. MURA means irregularity caused by humans. Is everything evenly distributed? Are people working together worse than normally? MURA may be a sign of problems such as poor planning or training. MURI means stress and strain. It can be caused by shortages of manpower or misallocated resources. All of these should be avoided as they negatively impact performance.</p>

                <h3>What is TQE and how can it be achieved? </h3>

                <p>TQE stands for total quality excellence. It can be achieved by strictly following quality processes such as a well defined Total Quality Management system, Product Life-Cycle Management, and concurrent engineering. Following best practices such as quality circles and green engineering will also help achieve total quality excellence. </p>

                <h3>What are the benefits of using standard components? </h3>

                <p>By using standard components parts can be shared by multiple products making it easier to build a family of products. Manufacturing costs can be reduced and more options are possible. Maintenance is easier as parts are more common and easier to find. </p>

                <h2>Other Green PLM Methods:</h2>

                <h3>Green Supply Chain Management</h3>

                <p>Companies should aim to not only reduce their own waste but also aim to eliminate waste along their supply chain. Companies may be unaware of potential savings that can come from a green supply chain. General Motors for example reduced disposal costs by $12 million by implementing a reusable container system with parts suppliers. Companies can reduce shipping costs in other ways such as by eliminating hazardous materials and reducing the number of shipments. </p>

                <h3>Active Packaging</h3>

                <p>Smart Packaging can help increase quality by better protecting products from damage or loss. They can employ many technologies such as shock detection, orientation sensors, RFID tracking, temperature monitoring, moisture control and corrosion inhibition. By employing these methods companies can ensure that products reach the consumer undamaged and don’t get lost. </p>

                <h3>LEED Certification </h3>

                <p>Buildings can be built with sustainability in mind. The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program is one such program which encourages the development of such buildings. LEED certified buildings feature sustainable green design including energy and water use, waste management, transportation, indoor air quality, and toxin free environments. </p>
