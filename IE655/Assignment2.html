                <p>Virtual Company Name: Titan International Manufacturing</p>

                <p>Titan International Manufacturing's goal is to create environmentally friendly, smart, and sustainable washing machines and driers for home use. Every day millions of Americans wash their laundry in so-called "dumb washing machines" that are old, outdated, energy inefficient, and lack the capabilities to filter harmful laundry byproducts like microplastics from entering the environment. Our smart washer will feature an intuitive interface and internet capabilities all with the goal of reducing waste.</p>

                <h2>Collaborating Companies:</h2>
                <h3>Tosei America Inc:</h3>

                <h2>Chapter 6 Images:</h2>
                <p>IMG_1122 Based on this image of a boat propellor with salt on it the customer wanted an ocean going boat. The propellor needed to be strong to avoid being damaged by ocean debris and also make of a material that wouldn’t deteriorate in salt water. The size of the propellor needs to be sufficient to move the boat. The propellor in this image has obvious signs of corrosion which indicates that a better material could have been chosen which may have been better able to stand up to the salt water. </p>
                <p>IMG_1123 Based on the image of this metal component the customer needed the boat engine and propellor system to be able to make certain adjustments. The ability to raise and lower the prop when entering shallow water and placing the boat on a trailer are important for maritime operations. The part appears to be needlessly complicated with too many parts in manufacturing. The parts also don’t seem to fit well together indicating poor workmanship. </p>
                <p>IMG_1145 The use of wood in the hull may have been a stylistic choice for the customer as wooden boats invoke a more classic image. Wood also has a better strength to weight ratio that other boat materials such as aluminum, steel, and some fiberglass. In this image however, we see the results of a material that was perhaps not properly maintained when left below the waterline. The paint used may have not been sufficient to stand up to ocean conditions. </p>
                <p>IMG_1148 The paint used for the hull must be able to withstand the salt air of the sea. The color should make the boat visible on the water so potential rescues can more easily find the boat. The boat must be able to be easily repainted when needed. The paint damage on this boat shows that this boat is in need of repair. </p>
                <p>IMG_1150 The damage to the port side bow section could have been caused by poor workmanship, poor materials, or improper maintenance. The boat may have collided with something damaging its protective paint. The damage eventually spread. </p>
                <p>IMG_1151 The wood in this photo shows signs of damage from termites. The designers could have used a more termite resistant material for this piece like fiberglass or aluminum. The area could have also been treated to remove the termites. </p>
                <p>IMG_1157 The steel supports of this dock are showing signs of corrosion. This material may not be suitable to the harsh salt water of this marina. The steel columns may have held up better if they had a more suitable protective coating. The poor material choice and poor craftsmanship lead to a design that it not sustainable and will need to be replaced. </p>
                <p>IMG_1158 The floating dock has begun to warp in some locations creating a tripping hazard. The materials used here are unable to stand up to the movement of the waves. The condition of the wood points to a lack of maintenance. This will eventually need to be replaced and is not sustainable. </p>
                <p>IMG_1159 The slip here is too narrow to accommodate a second boat. This results in lost revenue for the marina which now can’t rent out the other slip. The requirements for slip size may have been missed during the design phase. </p>
                <p>IMG_1171 This engine has corroded and deteriorated to the point where it is no longer viable for use. The materials used are heavily corroded and seem like they weren’t up to the job. Poor maintenance of the engine may have played a role in its demise. </p>
                <p>IMG_1172 These fuel tanks are corroded which may have caused them to leak. The material used was subject to corrosion. This could cause marine fuel to leak into the water. This is not green or sustainable. </p>
                <p>IMG_1144 Shows a number of boat parts scattered around. This area used for disposal may not meet green requirements of waste disposal if these rotting and potentially toxic parts are left close to the water. The disposal of products that have reached the end of their lives must be taken into consideration during the PLM phases. <p>

                <h2>CORA Analisys</h2>
                <p>Through the analysis we uncovered the following customer requirements and corresponding importance ratings for the Greenwash System.</p>

                Laundry cycle scheduling: 5</p>

                <p>Based on this we calculated that the items with the highest AIR values are the following. </p>
                <p>Smart Product Management System (390): Our washing machine software must be able to accurately control the waste output of the machine, track and manage energy usage, and alert customers to potential issues. The management system sits at the cornerstone of what makes Greenwash unique and therefore it makes sense to dedicate the most resources to it. Our software department will be one of our larger teams. </p>
                <p>Quality Control Checkpoints (382): The implementation and control of quality control checkpoints throughout the manufacturing processes will help us identify problems earlier. Quality and reliability is a hugely important metric for washing machines as most customers expect their machine to last for many years. </p>
                <p>Computerized Manufacturing (351): Our manufacturing process must be highly automated in order to be efficient and green. By planning every aspect of the process before implementation we can identify issues earlier and prevent issues later. It makes sense to tackle this item as early as possible and give it additional funding. </p>
                <p>These items will integrate with our manufacturing plans by allowing us to dedicate resources up front to deal with our more important issues. </p>

                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>In this project we applied the CORA methodology to design and requirements analysis. Requirements gathering is an extremely important part of engineering. Many projects fail because they missed requirements. Scope change can be an expensive mess later in the project and should be caught earlier if possible.</p>
                
                <h2>Social Networking:</h2>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=336752>Article one</a> was about 3d printing holiday items. I brought up how this would enable people to make gifts and specialized items on the fly. One day in the future we may see toy manufacturers adopt 3d printing as a distribution method. There is a concern over copyright of these items much like modern photography. We also discussed the possibility of 3d printing tools and supplies in remote locations. There was additional discussion of 3d printing in various industries.</p>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=333613>Article two</a> was on HR6665, a bill to allow US Territories to build off shore wind farms. Some people oppose offshore wind for aesthetic and environmental concerns but the general feeling among the discussion group was supportive. </p>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=333614>Article three</a> was on Elon Musk's Hyperloop One. Some critics are skeptical that the idea could be a practical means of transportation. The idea of a high speed train would be revolutionary for intercity transport but there are a lot of obstacles in the way such as cost, technology, safety, and urban planning that must be considered. </p>
