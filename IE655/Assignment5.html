                <p>Virtual Company Name: Titan International Manufacturing</p>

                <p>Titan International Manufacturing's goal is to create environmentally friendly, smart, and sustainable washing machines and driers for home use. Every day millions of Americans wash their laundry in so-called "dumb washing machines" that are old, outdated, energy inefficient, and lack the capabilities to filter harmful laundry byproducts like microplastics from entering the environment. Our smart washer will feature an intuitive interface and internet capabilities all with the goal of reducing waste.</p>

                <h2>Methods Applied: </h2>
                
                <h3>Computer Numerical Control: </h3>
                <p>Using CNC machines we can automate the creation of various metal components that will be used to make the boat engines and other fittings. This will allow us to create the basic structure of our boats using fewer parts. Designing for minimum parts is a goal of this venture. We will be working closely with Tosei and MPAL in this project. This will be a part our Six-Sigma process where we strive for zero defects. </p>

                <h3>CORA Analysis:</h3>
                <p>We will be perfomring CORA Analysis to determine what our customers are looking for in a personal watercraft. Cora is </p>

                <h3>CAD: </h3>
                <p>We will be extensively employing CAD and computer simulation in the design of the boat. Models will be created to test various shapes in different water conditions. </p>

                <h3>Poka-Yoke</h3>
                <p>Poka-Yoke means "mistake proofing." It calls for quality checks at every level and respects the intelligence and experience of all levels of worker from design to manufacturing when it comes to the whole manufacturing process. The overall goal is to strive for zero defects.</p>

                <h3>FEMA/PRFA</h3>
                <p>By analyzing our risk through the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis and Process Failure Risk Analysis models we can determine which areas of manufacturing are the highest risk and apply resources to correct these areas. By employing these methods we hope to avoid unnecessary waste through failure of processes.</p>

                <h2>PFRA Analysis</h2>
                <p>Process Failure Risk Analysis is used to identify and minimize potential failure risks in the process as well as the components. We applied this analysis to the bilge pump installation process of our boats. The bilge pump is a critical part that drains water from the hull of the boat. Without this component a boat can fill with water and sink. Through this analysis we identified potential areas where failures would be most costly such as a faulty pump being delivered to a customer.</p>
                <p>Note that the first quality check has an RPN of 210 when we fail to catch a faulty pump. Down the line this escalates to an RPN of 720 if the entire boat passes the test when it should have failed. Therefore it is critical that we get our inspection process right early.</p>
                
                <h2>CORA Analysis</h2>
                <p>Through the analysis we uncovered the following customer requirements and corresponding importance ratings for the Greenboat.</p> 
                <p>Buoyancy Requirements	5<br>
                Powerful Engine	5<br>
                Colors Available	2<br>
                Maintain high reliability rating	5<br>
                Smart Phone Connectivity	2<br>
                Be a green company	3<br>
                Provides statistics on usage 	2<br>
                Provides statistics on waste saved	2<br>
                Educate customer	5<br>
                Algee Repellency	5<br>
                Quiet Operation	4<br>
                WiFi Reliability	3<br>
                Comfortable	5<br>
                Ergonomic Seating	4<br>
                Ergonomic Controls	4<br>
                Safety	5<br>
                Self boating capabilities	4<br>
                Towing Capable	4<br>
                Built in cooler	2<br>
                Weather alerts	5</p>

                <p>Based on this we calculated that the items with the highest AIR values are the following. </p>
                <p>Industrial Design Team (410): Significant resources will gi towards our design team. They will have a hand in developing the batteries, motor, and hull. These are by far the most important parts of a boat.</p>
                <p>Computerized Manufacturing (396): We are on the cutting edge of boat technology. This will require a highly sophisticated computer design system.  Our manufacturing process must be highly automated in order to be efficient and green. By planning every aspect of the process before implementation we can identify issues earlier and prevent issues later. It makes sense to tackle this item as early as possible and give it additional funding. </p>
                <p>Quality Control Checkpoints (387): No customer wants their boat to sink or leave them stranded. The implementation and control of quality control checkpoints throughout the manufacturing processes will help us identify problems earlier. Quality and reliability is a hugely important metric for boats as there is already a stigma in the boating community that boating is an extremely expensive hobby and that boat stands for "bust out another thousand." We hope to change this image.</p>
                <p>These items will integrate with our manufacturing plans by allowing us to dedicate resources up front to deal with our more important issues. </p>

                <h2>Innovative Green PLM Design: </h2>

                <img src="img/boat.jpg" alt="Boat">

                <p>Many people use personal watercraft for recreational use such as speed boats and jet skis. The traditional speed boat is often powered by a two stroke engine that runs on a mixture of oil and gasoline. Although these engines became subject to stricter regulations in 2004 and again in 2007 they are still not held to the same standards as automobiles and can still leak a significant amount of gas, oil, and other lubricants into the water. Additionally, the harsh chemicals used to clean and maintain boats have a negative effect on water quality and wildlife can be disturbed by the loud noise.</p>
                <p>Just as the electric car continues to revolutionize the automotive industry, we hope that similar electrification strategies can be applied to watercraft.</p>
                <img src="img/battery.jpg" alt="Battery">
                <p>For years electric motors have either been reserved for small craft on small lakes or slow moving trolling motors for fishing. Some tinkerers have managed to build their own electric speed boats using electric car batteries and some companies have managed to build purpose built race boats but as of yet nobody has brought a true eco-friendly electric speedboat to the mass market due to high cost. Our goal is to create an electric powered boat that can match the performance of a conventional gasoline powered pleasure craft. The materials used to manufacture the boat must be purpose built and reflect good sustainable green engineering practices.</p>

                <h2>Green Product Innovation Introduction:</h2>
                <h3>Green Supply Chain Management: </h3>
                <p><a href=https://medium.com/@KodiakRating/the-green-supply-chain-true-sustainability-or-just-one-big-marketing-stunt-fa84a773a13a>Green Supply Chain Management</a> has become something of a marketing buzzword in recent years as firms scramble to "greenwash" their image by placing unrealistic green targets they have no intention of meeting. True green supply chain management is driven by careful planning and targeted cost reduction through waste reduction, not just by a desire to look good to customers. One such example is Campbells Soup who managed to reduce waste across their supply chain by 85% which yielded significant savings. Our company strives to reduce costs associated with our supply chain </p>
                
                <h3>Just in Time Inventory System: </h3>
                <p><a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp>Just in time</a>is an inventory management system which increases efficiency and reduces waste and storage costs. It requires accurate demand forecast so items needed by the production line are available when needed. We will employ this strategy to reduce our storage needs and waste.</p>
                
                <h3>LEED Certification: </h3>
                <p><a href=https://new.usgbc.org/leed>Buildings</a> can be built with sustainability in mind. The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program is one such program which encourages the development of such buildings. LEED certified buildings feature sustainable green design including energy and water use, waste management, transportation, indoor air quality, and toxin free environments. We will strive for all of our facilities to be LEED Platinum certified. </p>

                <h3>3D Printing: </h3>
                <p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing>3D printing</a> is revolutionizing manufacturing. 3D printing enables complex components to be created with greater ease. Additive manufacturing uses less material than traditional methods where parts are cut from larger pieces. 3D printing also allows for rapid prototyping of items saving development and manufacturing time and resources. We plan to make heavy use of 3D Printing in our boats for engine components to hulls.</p>

                <h3>Rapid Prototyping:</h3>
                <p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_prototyping>Rapid prototyping</a> allows products to be developed with greater speed. By applying tools like CNC, 3D printing, and CAD, companies can quickly and efficiently evaluate designs and parts without needing expensive and time consuming manufacturing setups. This allows parts to be shared and evaluated faster which can lead to the earlier identification of defects and other problems.</p>
                
                <h3>Telecommuting:</h3>
                <p><a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/05/04/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-telecommuting/#122048c4418f>Telecommuting</a>allows employees to work in remote locations without the need to be in the office. It is done through the use of video conferencing, collaborative software, and other communications tools. This provides employees with the flexibility to work in locations which are convenient to them and gives businesses access to talent across the globe. Additionally there is a benefit in terms of reduced costs of commuting and time wasted traveling. We will use telecomuting to reduce our commuting costs and environmental impact.</p>

                <h3>Eco Friendly Packaging:</h3>
                <p><a href=https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9095199/majority-of-consumers-paying-attention-to-environmentally-friendly-packaging/>Eco Friendly Packaging</a> aims to reduce the disposable packaging used in a product. Many boats come wrapped in plastic when new which creates a lot of unnecessary waste. We will instead provide the customer with reusable weather resistant covers that can be reused time and time again to protect their boat.</p>

                <h3>Organic Batteries:</h3>
                <p><a href=https://www.buzzworthy.com/eco-friendly-battery/>Organic batteries</a> are longer lasting and more eco-friendly batteries made of organic compounds. This cutting edge technology will allow our boats to travel farther and cheaper.</a></p>
           
                <h3>Eco Friendly Cleaning Products:</h3>
                <p><a href=https://www.boatus.org/findings/47/>Many traditional boat cleaners</a> are toxic to the environment and many which claim to be green are also in fact toxic. We will educate our consumers on cleaning products and provide and use only the best on our boats.</p>
           
                <h3>New Recycled Plastic:</h3>
                <p><a href=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/just-10-us-plastic-gets-recycled-new-kind-plastic-could-change>Plastic</a> has historically been difficult to recycle as it retains traces of dyes and chemicals used to treat it in the past. Researchers are hoping a new plastic made with dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds can change this. The plastic is easier to recycle with chemical methods. We will seek to use recyclable plastic in all of our products.</p>

                <h2>Digital Manufacturing and Sustainable Green Transition Plan: </h2>
                <h3>Marketing Plan</h3>
                <p>When people think of "sustainable green engineering" many would envision expensive solar powered factories making eco friendly products but there is far more to sustainable green engineering than just the environment. Sustainability refers not just to environmental concerns but also to how sustainable a process is from an economic standpoint.</p> 
                <p>Far from just a marketing ploy, sustainable green engineering can have an enormous positive impact on a firms bottom line. Deploying PLM tools and methods will allow the company to develop new products faster, cheaper, and to a higher standard of quality. By standardizing your PLM platform you will see significant increases in productivity and a huge reduction in costs.</p>
                <p>One typical arguments against PLM is the high startup cost, however the cost savings over the next several years will offset this cost. Plus, although there is an implementation and training cost in switching to a new system, many businesses ignore the costs of holding on to legacy systems which are often increase exponentially over time as they <a href=https://www.intivix.com/the-risks-of-outdated-technology-why-legacy-systems-cost-you-more-than-you-realize/>become more and more difficult to update and maintain.</a></p>
                <p>PLM allows for designers and engineers to work closely with each other by sharing the same models and framework without the need for cumbersome transitions between teams. Communication is streamlined and teams can more effectively bring new ideas to fruition. The sharing of these components allows for the design of common components and modules which can be shared by multiple products, providing a highly scalable framework on which to build an entire product line.</p>
                <p>Top companies use PLM to deliver quality products at a rapid pace. The time to update your strategies is now, before your company is left behind.</p>

                <h3>Transition Plan:</h3>
                <p>The transition plan has been prepared using the CimPGR model. </p>
                <img src="CimPGR/Layer0.png" alt="Layer0">
                <img src="CimPGR/Layer1.png" alt="Layer0">
                <h4>Layer 0:</h4>
                <h5>Inputs:</h5>
                <p>I1A0: Customer Feedback - We will work closely with our customers to understand their needs and how our product offerings can meet them. We can identify areas where we are weaker in this way.</p>
                <p>I2A0: Requirements - Our design team will gather requirements from stakeholders and create meaningful action items in our PLM system.</p>
                <p>I3A0: Materials - We must take care to not overstock materials or order the wrong things. This could lead to unnecessary waste and delays.</p>
                <p>I4A0: Design - Our product must be designed for manufacturing. We should employ best practices including design for minimum parts and modular products using CAD software.</p>
                <p>I5A0: Planning - Planning is imperative to success. We need clearly defined goals for a business to succeed. We can reduce waste by planning ahead.</p>

                <h5>Controls:</h5>
                <p>C1A0: Time - We must take a swift but mindful approach when implementing our plan. It is important we don't miss any market opportunities and can easily adapt to changing conditions.</p>
                <p>C2A0: Finance - The goal of the PLM process is ultimately increased profits. This is an investment in our future. As such we need to be mindful of how much we are spending and carefully budget to meet these requirements.</p>
                <p>C3A0: Safety - Safety must be at the forefront of everything we do from the design of our products to our manufacturing systems. Accidents can cause unneeded delays and waste valuable resources.</p>
                <p>C4A0: Training Requirements - With any new PLM system there will be new training required. This training is important because our process will not be correctly implemented without it. A process implemented with poor training will only lead to more waste.</p>
                <p>C5A0: Legal Requirements - Our company must opperate within the confines of the law. If we are caught doing illegal things we could be subject to fines which will cut into our bottom line. We will also suffer reputational harm.</p>

                <h5>Resources:</h5>
                <p>R1A0: Equipment - Our state of the art equipment such as 3D printers and and CNC machines enables us to produce products more efficiently than traditional methods.</p>
                <p>R2A0: Software - Our CAD software and PLM systems enable easier collaboration between teams and allow us to design products in the digital space first saving materials.</p>
                <p>R3A0: Workforce - Our workforce is enthusiastic about our industry and passionate about their craft. We can leverage their experience at all levels as part of our Poka-Yoke strategy.</p>
                <p>R4A0: Collaborative Partners - Our partner companies understand what we are doing and can provide the tools to help.</p>
                
                <h5>Outputs:</h5>
                <p>O1A0: Positive Environmental Impact - By implementing this process we will reduce waste and have a positive impact on the environment.</p>
                <p>O2A0: Total Quality - PLM will enable us to implement a total quality program.</p>
                <p>O3A0: Sustainability - PLM will enable us to improve our process and be more sustainable both economically and environmentally.</p>
                
                <h4>Layer1:</h4>
                <p>Layer1 is a child layer of layer0. It splits the steps in later0 into smaller action items with their own assigned resources with details. The layer shows specific information flow, material flow, and allocation of resources.</p>
                
                <h2>Video Conferencing and Design Review: </h2>
                <h3>The purpose of the video-conferencing session is to conduct a virtual product design review? What is a product design review? How did you prepare your files for this web-based VC product design review?</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this session was to conduct a design review. A design review is where state-holders review a design to ensure that requirements have been met. I prepared for this by uploading my nearly completed assignment 5 to my website to send to my partner.</p>
                
                <h3>What were the most important steps in your product design review process?</h3>
                <p>During the review we highlighted the requirements of our design and showed how these requirements are met. It is important to discuss design earlier rather than later because changes become more expensive to make.</p>

                <h3>What software did you use for VC and how? (Must include 3-4 screen prints of the VC session as a proof.)</h3>
                <p>We used Google Hangouts for video conferencing. We kept a log of our discussion in the chat window for records purposes.</h>

                <p><b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu):</b>   Hi Timothy<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Hello<br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu)  </b>  Can you tell me a little about what your product is?<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  My product is an electric speedboat. Traditionally there has been a large divide between electric boats, which are typically smaller slower boats, and recreational leisure boats which are inefficient gas powered boats. Our goal is to create an electric boat which matches the power of a traditional gas powered boat. <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  That is a very interesting design. How did you work with your collaborating companies?<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Our main collaborators are WAGO whose expertise in marine design we hope to use to our advantage, Tosei America who will assist us in creating our manufacturing equipment, MPAL who specializes in custom tooling, and Modern Machine Shop who will provide training for our workforce. <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  That is very interesting, I worked with two of the same collaborating companies. It will be interesting to see if we used them in a similar way. <br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Want to tell me more about your product? <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  Sure. My product was a tire that is made from recycled materials, that can also be recycled into a new tire once it has worn out. We were able to achieve this by improving the production process to eliminate inefficiencies to lower the cost. The company is called Redemption Tire Co. and the product is called "The Redeemed Tire."<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Interesting. How did you work with your collaborators? <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  I worked with Continental Corp., a company that has been making tires for nearly 150 years to provide insight into creating a lean process for creating tires. I also worked with MAPAL, which works in creating custom tooling in order to ensure that there are no defects created during our manufacturing process. We used MTConnect, a program to connect all of the machines in the factory over the same network so that they would be in sync. Lastly, we worked with Modern Machine as a resource for process improvements and as a platform to share our processes.<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  It sounds like we had similar ideas on how to work with MPAL and Modern Machine Shop<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Ok let's get started with the product design review. What are our goals for this review today? <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  For the design review today, we should highlight the requirements of our design and show how these requirements are met. Since the cost of making a change to the design earlier on is exponentially lower than later on in the product life cycle, we want to make sure all of these requirements are met during the development phase.<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Ok. I have prepared my design documentation here http://www.timbarbara.com/IE655/Assignment5.html<br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  Thank you for sending the links. I will open your CORA spreadsheet to see your requirements.<br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  How did you meet the requirements for towing capability of the electric motor to match the performance of a traditional gasoline motor when towing a skier or a tube?<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  We are setting benchmarks based on commercially available gasoline powered boats on the market. Generally most designs call for up to 70hp to tow a tube and 90-100hp for a skier. We will target these numbers for our electric motors. <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  Performance is critical, especially for water skiers. As a water skier myself, one of the most important aspects of performance is that the boat is able to accelerate quickly to pull the skier out of the water. I think that an electric motor would be very good for this as long as it has comparable horsepower to a traditional gasoline engine used on ski boats.<br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  I also like the fact that electric boats will lead to less lake pollution.<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Let's move on to your design now<br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  Here is the link for my files to share:  https://alexandersyzonenko.weebly.com/files-for-vc.html<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Ok. I see you have a number of requirements. What do you think is the most important target? <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  The most important requirements that we needed to satisfy was the safety of the finished product while it was in use and the use of recycled materials to create the tires. Safety is our number one priority, since a malfunction of the tire while one the road can cause accidents and potential injuries or even death. Working with Continental Corp. helped us make sure that we were meeting required performance characteristics helped us to ensure that we had a design that was safe for the customer. Our other critical requirement was in the materials used. The idea of the product is that it is a tire that is made from recycled tires, that can also be recycled once it it has completed its usable life. This part is critical in the sustainable green aspect of the design.<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Safety is definitely key and is one of the major obstacles to recycled tires seeing widespread use. What kinds of tools did you use to analyze the safety of recycled tires? <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  The PFRA/FMEA tool was very helpful in identifying all potential failure modes and addressing them in the product design and manufacturing process.<br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  What were some of the main challenges that you faced in the development of your design?<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Our biggest challenge is cost. Batteries and electric motors are far more expensive than their gasoline counterparts. In order for this product to gain market acceptance we need to get it to a price point where it's comparable to traditional gasoline boats. We are hoping recent advances in electric car technology will help with that. <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  That is a very good point. With the increase popularity of electric car manufacturer like Tesla, I think that performance of batteries and electric engines will improve a lot and become more affordable in the next few years.<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  What kinds of challenges have you faced with your design? <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  The biggest challenge that I faced in my design was to improve the process for de-vulcanizing the rubber in old tires so that it can be used again as a raw material. While this process is possible, it is costly and inefficient so it is hard to make a profit from it. Therefore we focused a lot on creating a lean process that would bring down the cost of recycling the material.<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  Very interesting. Creating an economically viable process would be highly important for tire recycling. <br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  For the last part of this conference I would like to take a moment to calculate how much time and energy was saved through holding a video conference. I would have had to travel from Union City to Newark in order to participate in person which would be a significant drive especially in heavy traffic. <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  I would have traveled from Randolph NJ, which is 23 miles from the NJIT campus. By conducting this design review over video conference, it seems that we were both able to avoid unnecessary traveling and reduce our carbon footprint.<br>
                <b>Timothy Barbara (tb248@njit.edu):     </b>  I feel we had a very productive session today. I think we can end here. Thank you for your time. <br>
                <b>Alexander Syzonenko (as934@njit.edu): </b>  I agree. Thank you for taking the time to conduct this design review. I was very interested in hearing about your design. Best of luck in the future.</p>
                
                <h3>How do you like this video-conferencing approach for collaborative CE/PLM problem solving?</h3>
                <p>Video conferencing provides an easy and cheap way to collaborate over long distances. It saves time and money that would be lost to travel otherwise and consequently is better for the environment.</p>

                <h3>What were the main challenges?</h3>
                <p>The main challenges were scheduling related. Trying to find a partner to coordinate with proved challenging as many people were not available on the weekend. Keeping accurate notes of the conversation was a challenge that we solved by using text chat to suplement our conversation.</p>
                
                <h3>What worked well, and what did not, and why?</h3>
                <p>Sharing design files over the internet worked well as did using the text window for communication. This provided us with easy access to files and a record of the conversation. We had some intermittent connectivity issues during the call and at one point one of Alexander's monitors failed. These issues could be chalked up to neither party having access to professional grade video conferencing software or enterprise internet access.</p>

                <h3>In comparison to a face-to-face visit, versus VC, what is the estimated carbon footprint saving to the environment? How did you calculate this result?</h3>
                <p>To travel from my home to the NJIT Library would be 10.7 miles and 22 minutes. For Alexander to travel from his home to the same location would be 28.6 miles and 34 minutes. Round trip for both of us brings this to a total of 78.6 miles or 112 minutes of travel. Assuming we both drive average modern CUVs this comes out to .03 metric tons of carbon according to the below calculator.</p>

                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=344596>Article one. </a>This article provides a side by side comparison between the GoPro Hero7 Black and the DJI Osmo Pocket. Both cameras provide image stabilization at a similar price point. Outwardly the cameras both serve different purposes with the Osmo Pocket being more of a cinematic camera while the GoPro is a dedicated action camera. Overall it seems like these two cameras serve very different but it was interesting to see this comparison. Others were in agreement that comparing disimilar items is an interesting way to highlight specific features.</p>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=344597>Article two. </a>This article discusses central banking's role in combating climate change. There are those who believe that banks should be required to do more to invest in sustainable green companies and discourage investment in non environmentally friendly ones. This has been controversial as many believe that it is not the place of regulating bodies to dictate where the market should focus funds. They argue that if proper disclosure is in place, money should naturally flow towards green projects. There was general agreement that expecting banks to self regulate has never proven a viable strategy in the past and banks should be compelled to invest in green technology.</p>
                <p><a href=https://njit2.mrooms.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=344598>Article three. </a>This article discusses shipping company Maersk's efforts to use more eco friendly bio fuels in order to reduce emissions from shipping. They have reduced emissions by 46% in the last few years and will continue to do so. By some estimates, just one mega container ship, can produce the same amount of pollution as 50 million cars.</p>
