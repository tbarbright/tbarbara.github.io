                <h1>Questions</h1>
                
                <h2>Explain why continual quality improvement is important. How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>In my company, we understand that continual quality improvement is a cornerstone of quality management. The people involved in a process should always be learning and growing within their roles in the organization. The processes by which products and services are delivered need to be innovated on as well as the products and services themselves. Continual improvement will allow a company to perform in a changing market and meet consumer expectations. Failure to improve leads to stagnation in products and services. When a company fails to innovate another company may see a prime opportunity to swoop in and grab market share with their own product. History is filled with examples of companies who didn’t adopt a policy of continuous improvement and failed to innovate which ultimately cost them their business. We use many quality approaches to avoid this fate ourselves. </p>

                <p>Take Kodak for example, which throughout the 80s and 90s was one of the largest companies in the world. When the digital camera revolution took off Kodak failed to keep up and change with the times as companies like Fujifilm, Sony, Cannon, and Nikon took over more and more of the digital market. </p>

                <p>Another famous example of a company failing to adopt a strategy of continuous improvement is Blockbuster. The dominance of the massive video store chain was challenged in the early 2000s by a startup known as Netflix. Blockbuster’s revenue model was largely based on charging late fees to customers who failed to return videos on time. Netflix on the other hand invented a new model around subscriptions which allowed them to generate reliable revenue without punishing customers for keeping movies for too long. When Blockbuster CEO John Antioco became convinced of the threat posed by Netflix he immediately tried to turn the company around by dropping late fees and investing heavily in services like Blockbuster Online and Total Access. Investors were displeased by the short term losses which totaled $400 million and ousted him as CEO. The new CEO Jim Keyes reversed this investment strategy and the video giant went bankrupt merely 5 years later. Had Blockbuster employed a strategy of continuous improvement these changes may not have had to be so drastic and sudden. Blockbuster could have been spared had it been more open as an organization to the idea of change. </p>

                <h2>What is management’s role in continual quality improvement ?</h2>

                <p>Management plays a key role in quality. They must strive to maintain a high standard of quality and lead their teams by example. They are responsible for correcting poor quality within their company and reporting and dealing with quality issues as they arise. A good quality focused manager should perform several key steps to ensure that they are doing their best for the quality of the organization. Managers must ensure that a policy of continuous improvement is enforced at all levels of the organization from the lower production workers to the planners and upper management. All services and products must focus on improvement. </p>

                <p>Managers should set goals for employees that push them to do better without setting arbitrary or unrealistic targets. A good manager should be a mentor to their subordinates. Managers need to be clear with their employees on what the metrics are measured and how they will be measured. Managers must recognize achievement and reward employees accordingly. </p>

                <p>They need to measure and track performance with all of the quality tools and maintain charts and data such as QFD matrices and statistical process control. They must also be prepared to lead exercises in using quality tools such as fishbone charts and control charts. </p>

                <h2>Discuss the Kaizen approach. How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>Kaizen is the Japanese concept of continual improvement. Kai is the Japanese word for change and Zen is the Japanese word for change. Kaizen is therefore “good change” which is performed on a continuous basis. Kaizen focuses on improvement in all areas including people, products, and processes. Kaizen is a slow constant change, not a radical sudden change. Improvements can come from any level in the organization as any employee can be an expert in their field and therefore their opinions matter. My company uses a basic five step approach to implementation called the 5 Ss. </p>

                <p>The first of these is Seiri which is Japanese for Sort. This means sorting through all items and getting rid of the unnecessary parts. This can include tools, machines, products, paperwork, etc. The goal is to simplify the process by removing bloat and cleaning up the area to reduce distractions. </p>

                <p>Next comes Seiton or “set in order.” Here we make the workflow smooth and easy. We should place workstations in order to increase efficiency and allow products to flow from station to station. </p>

                <p>Next comes Seiso or Shine. We must clean and inspect the workplace regularly. We should keep the workplace safe and easy to work in. The idea is that anyone should be able to detect people within 50 feet in 5 seconds even if they are unfamiliar with the workspace. </p>

                <p>Next we Seiketsu or Standardize. We want to standardize the process used to clean and streamline the workplace. We need to develop and document a work structure that will support the new practices are part of the daily routine. We should assign tasks and responsibilities to make sure the workspace is kept clean and the process in order.</p>

                <p>Finally comes Shitsuke or Self-Discipline. Here we make sure that our 5S process is followed by organizing training sessions and audits. We implement improvements wherever we can and identify new areas that can be improved. </p>

                <h2>How would you describe a lean system? How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>Lean is based on the Toyota Production System developed by Taiichi Ohno. It was first developed for manufacturing but has since spread into other industries as well. A lean system is one in which a better product is developed using less materials. The idea behind lean is that if things are done right the first time and waste is reduced, every resource can be placed towards production, reducing costs and increasing output. </p>

                <p>My company has adopted this system by working to eliminate waste on our production line. There are several types of waste that we work to eliminate. First is transport waste where products are moved but not required for the process. Our company encountered this when we realized that our machines are being moved back and forth between two facilities for various stages of production. We refined the manufacturing process to reduce the need to move things between facilities. </p>

                <p>We have reduced inventory waste by trying to predict demand and shipping units as soon as they are complete. This reduces our storage costs. We can also reduce our overproduction related waste in this way. </p>

                <p>By organizing our facility according to 5Ss we have reduced our motion waste and our waiting waste. By designing an efficient factory we can also reduce our over processing waste. Finally by employing TQM principals we can reduce our defect waste.</p>

                <h2>What is lean six-sigma and how would you apply it to a quality management system?</h2>

                <p>Six-sigma is focused on the elimination of defects in all levels of a process. It was introduced by engineer Bill Smith at Motorola in 1980. A six-sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some product are statistically expected to be free of defects. Lean six-sigma builds on this idea. The lean six-sigma method focuses on removing waste and reducing variation. It combines six-sigma with lean manufacturing. The goal is to reduce the eight kinds of waste or muda found in traditional manufacturing, defects, over-production, waiting, non-utilized talent, transportation, inventory, motion, and extra-processing. Lean six-sigma aims to improve the process of making a product in a collaborative environment. </p>

                <p>Lean six-sigma follows a five step approach to process improvement known as DMAIC, or Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. First we must define the business problem that we are looking to solve. We should seek facts and clarify objectives. Next we must measure the current baseline performance for improvement. We collect data on our process in areas we seek to improve. Next we must analyze this data and select a root cause for elimination. We must find potential causes of the problem and identify how the process inputs affect outputs. Next we must improve the process by identifying and implementing a solution. Next we must control the changes and ensure stability and sustainability. </p>

                <h2>Define benchmarking. Define auditing. How does benchmarking and auditing relate to each other?</h2>

                <p>Benchmarking is a technique to measure the success of an organization or product by comparing it against a standard in its market. The technique was developed in the 1980s and 1990s. Benchmarking seeks to uncover the secrets to success of a product or service and learn how they can be applied. The result is a defined set of best practices and standards set throughout an industry. This can be done by looking at data from other businesses in the same industry or those in other industries which use similar processes to produce products. We should look for industry leaders and cutting edge techniques. During this process, companies may share information for mutual benefit. </p>

                <p>This is where auditing comes in. Auditing is an on-site inspection which certifies that a certain process is being followed. Auditors are independent consultants take a systematic approach in which they examine processes and procedures to identify gaps and noncompliance areas. This can focus on quality, finance, processes, or people. In order for any benchmarking effort to be a success we need auditors in place to make sure the process is followed and to gain access to new information. Changes should be suggested by auditors to maintain standards set by benchmarking. The initial audit can help define this baseline for benchmarking. </p>

                <h2>How can you apply benchmarking data in auditing processes, systems, designs, products, factories and services?</h2>

                <p>When a benchmarking project nears its end both parties involved will engage in analysis of the data collected. This data will be both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative data becomes the point from which future success is measured. Once our new process is in place we will compare our performance against this expectation. Qualitative data on the other hand covers much more subjective matters. This can include things like that employee policies, training procedures, and management styles. This data may tell us more than pure numbers of quantitative data. The atmosphere in which results are achieved plays heavily into the results themselves. Quantitative information like a production target tells us little about how this target was met. If we blindly set targets without considering qualitative factors we are setting ourselves up for failure. Qualitative data must be examined to uncover relationships between it and the desired outcomes. We can look at this through cause and effect relationships. For example. Why does this company hit this production target? Because their employees take great pride in their work. Why do they take great pride? They know their work is valued. How do they know that their work is valued? Because the company provides an attractive reward structure. In this way we can see how qualitative data analysis is important to hit quantitative targets. </p>

                <h2>What is a JIT system? How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>JIT stands for Just in Time. It is a method of production that calls for components and materials to be delivered only when they are needed and in the quantities that they are needed in. JIT was developed Taiichi Ohno in the 1950s. It was originally named the Toyota Production System (TPS) as it was first used by Japanese automaker Toyota in postwar Japan. The process was subsequently adopted by many other companies and renamed to just in time (JIT).</p>

                <p>In my company we call on managers to examine their manufacturing processes starting with their output. Rather than store massive amounts of inventory we want to ship this inventory to customers as soon as it is ready. In order to do this we need to make sure that we are only producing the inventory that is needed to fulfill demand and not a tremendous excess. We accomplish this through demand forecasting based on past sales. On the other end of the production line, we consequently need to ensure that we are only receiving parts to produce inventory that we need. Excess material is considered wasteful as money needs to be spent on storage. Maintaining a proper just in time manufacturing system requires close collaboration with suppliers and partners as inventory demands may need to be shifted to satisfy increasing and decreasing production requirements. </p>

                <h2>What are the benefits of JIT/lean? How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>The first benefit of a just in time system is a reduction in waste. Just in time directly addresses several different types of Muda or waste. First just in time prevents overproduction of goods. Overproduction increases lead times and storage costs as goods need to be stored for extended periods after production. Just in time also reduces waiting as components are procured only when needed. It prevents unnecessary inventory from taking up valuable factory space. </p>

                <p>Another benefit to just in time comes in the form of reduced cycle time. A lower cycle time means goods are produced faster which has the benefit of reducing costs. As there is only so much being produced at one time more effort can be focused on production rather than storage and logistics. </p>

                <p>Just in time enables firms to focus on continuous improvement. As products are being produced in response to orders it is easier to make production changes which will improve quality. These changes should be made without completely stopping production. </p>

                <p>Just in time requires close collaboration from suppliers who can respond to changes in the market. Building these sorts of close relationships with suppliers is essential to any large company. </p>

                <p>My company employs just in time production in our facility. When we build new washing machines we do so only when we are reasonably confident that we will meet demand. To do this we use demand forecasting based on past sales. We work closely with suppliers to ensure that they are ready to handle increased and decreased production. </p>

                <h2>Discuss automation system ideas for JIT/lean . How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>Automation is the use of technology and machinery to remove the human element in assembly and production work. Automation reduces costs and reduces the occurrence of human error in production. The first component of an automated system is the control system. This is the “brain” of the operation. From here we can manage the production line and regulate its behavior. The use of information technology allows us to identify potential areas of improvement in our production line such as by collecting data for use in control charts. In an automated system specialized and general machines each perform a specific part of the assembly process often with minimal human intervention. In a just in time system it is important that we arrange our factory to enable the flow of goods through the factory without excessive wait times which could create bottlenecks. Creating products quickly and efficiently is a key part of just in time. </p>

                <p>In my company we design our factories with just in time in mind. Our machines are laid out in a logical way to reduce wasted time and energy by moving components across the factory floor. We make sure that our ordering system receives accurate information from our control system which gives us a complete picture of what we have in production currently and now well we are meeting customer demand. </p>

                <h2>Social Networking:</h2>
                <p>Article 1 was on Alavant’s Aluminum Matrix Composites which the company aims to use to create lighter landing gear. The group agreed that these innovative materials are a great example of innovation and sustainable green design as reductions in weight of aircraft will save fuel.</p>
                <p>Article 2 was on Roscamat's new electric tapping arm model that can tap between M2 and M27 vertically, horizontally and at any compound angle as well as do reaming, helicoil, fastening inserts and small hole drilling. This is a great example of a company adapting to changes in the market. The rise of composite materials means new methods need to be developed to deal with these materials. Roscamat is adapting to fit into this new market. </p>
                <p>Article 3 was on Seco Tools's new double quattormill 14 which allows for maximized face milling operations for companies with lower horsepower. This saves energy and increases cutting tool life. This is a great example of a company making a product greener.</p>
