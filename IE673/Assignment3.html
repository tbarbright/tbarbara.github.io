                <h1>Questions</h1>
                
                <h2>Discuss the importance of quality team works, and team building. How is your company doing this?</h2>
                <p>Team building and quality team work are fundamental building blocks of quality. Teams allow people to produce work that is greater than the sum of their parts. When working in a group people can leverage the knowledge and experience of their peers. Working in a team builds greater trust within the organization as people develop a better understanding of their peers’ work. Teams provide employees a sense of belonging which is a basic human need. Teamwork promotes greater communication among members of an organization. </p>

                <h2>It’s important that managers and organizations look carefully at how teams are managed and maintained. A poorly organized team is not a quality team and will lead to greater friction between members and could be detrimental to the organization as a whole. It is natural for conflict to arise within a team. It is important that members of the team can respond to conflict and work to resolve issues while minimizing loss of time. </h2>
                <p>My company strives to promote a positive team environment by encouraging everyone to speak up and be heard. We aim to build teams with personality traits and competencies that complement each other. An effective team is an important part of any quality organization.</p>

                <h2>How would you handle conflicts in quality teams? How is your company doing this?</h2>
                <p>Conflict is an inevitable part of teamwork. The thing that separates the successful teams from the rest is how conflict is handled. The needs of the individual members and their concerns must be balanced with the needs of the team and the organization. To ensure this my company works to establish clear criteria and processes for decision making within teams. Often times, conflict arises when there is no clear leader to make decisions or if the leader doesn’t work to involve team members in the decision. A bad leader may also attempt to use the team to advance a personal agenda. This must be carefully monitored and stopped before it becomes a problem. By monitoring the team you can also gauge the willingness of all members to participate and cooperate. Healthy and productive competition should be encouraged while unhealthy and counterproductive competition should be discouraged. Individual contributions should be recognized without giving one team member all of the credit for an idea. </p>
                <p>In managing conflict, team makeup must also be carefully considered. A good team should include people with different perspectives on problems who are comfortable voicing dissent. If people are too agreeable or I dissent is raised there may be some underlying problem that goes unrecognized in the organization. Dissent must be carefully managed without letting it get out of hand but employees also need ways to voice unpopular but necessary opinions. Successfully leveraging and managing conflict will ensure the success of a team and lead to greater quality. </p>

                <h2>How do you reward quality achievements in a team? How is your company doing this?</h2>
                <p>The quality achievements of both teams and individuals should be recognized in order to keep general morale high. An employee who feels valued and rewarded for their work is less likely to leave to find another job which saves costly recruiting and training costs. The most obvious way to reward employees is through compensation and pay for their work. This can include raises and bonuses. Companies could also consider stock options or some sort of profit sharing for hard working employees as this directly ties the success of the company to an employees compensation. Companies need to be careful about how they handle this though as an employee who misses out on a bonus or raise may assume the company is not doing well and jump ship.</p>
                <p>In order to effectively track employee effort and rewards the company needs to clearly define what it measures for success. This can be individual goals or some sort of team production target. After choosing the metric the company needs to then define how it will be measured and what the reward will be for hitting the target. Lastly, processes must be updated to include the new targets.</p>

                <h2>How do you communicate effectively? Focus on communication skills and soft-skills.</h2>
                <p>Effective communication is a critical component of any quality organization. Communication is critical to effective management and quality work. Communication is key in problem solving and identifying problems before they arise. Poor communication can lead to missed requirements and unresolved quality issues which will increase cost to the organization and negativity affect the overall quality of a product. Effective communication means that the intended message is not only received by the listener but also well understood. Beyond this the communicator must ensure that the message is acted upon properly. Is this process fails at any point the message is ineffective. </p>
                <p>This relies on the soft skills of the communicator which refers to their personality traits and people skills. These skills are not based on acquired knowledge but are learned over time by a persons upbringing and experience. Such skills allow a person to be better able to read a persons emotions and determine the effectiveness of a message and if it was received as intended. Effective communication should come with an understanding of the audience. This applies to all types of communication including verbal and non-verbal. Organizations which understand and use these soft skills will be more effective in the long term. </p>

                <h2>Why are listening skills important? How is your company doing this?</h2>
                <p>Listening skills go hand in hand with effective communication. Good listening ensures that a message is properly received and understood and the needed actions can be carried out by the listener. There are several factors which inhibit good listening. These include a lack of focus from the listener. If the message is not received or even if parts of the message are not received then it is likely that the actions taken will not be the correct actions. This can also happen if the message is interrupted or if the listener doesn’t care enough to listen in the first place. Preconceived ideas on the part of the listener may also play a role in communication breakdown as a listener may inject their own biases or misunderstandings into a message and perform the wrong actions. At my company we believe a good listener should ask questions about anything they don’t fully understand. We also encourage listeners to repeat instructions back to the giver in order to ensure the message was properly received. Taking notes should be encouraged as it leaves a record of the message. Lastly we encourage people to follow up after a message to make sure everything is clear.  </p>

                <h2>What are the management strategies for quality-focused interpersonal needs?</h2>
                <p>A good manager needs interpersonal skills to be effective. Positive team communication is essential to any quality focused team environment. It’s especially important when dealing with those outside the organization such as suppliers and customers. In order to facilitate good communication managers must build an effective team of people with good communication skills. In order to do this a manager must first recognize the value of these sorts of skills in a quality context. Once the need has been recognized a team should be assembled carefully selecting people with these desired skills. Managers should evaluate candidates for listening, patience, empathy, tact, open mindedness, friendliness, and an ability and desire to help others. These skills can be evaluated during interviews or may be based on a manager’s past experience with the employees in a team environment. While some people have great interpersonal skills others may need improvement. This will require training. Managers must be prepared to give that training. Lastly, good interpersonal skills should be rewarded by managers during employee review. By working to build a positive environment for team communication managers can assure greater quality in the organization as people work together more effectively. This fits in with an overall strategy of total quality management. </p>

                <h2>What are the principles of overcoming negativity and conflicts in the workplace? How is your company doing this?</h2>
                <p>Negativity can be detrimental to a quality team environment. Managers must always be on the lookout for warning signs within their team or organization and work to prevent the negative atmosphere from growing worse. Steps can be taken to eliminate negativity such as improving communication. The best way to reduce negativity is through frequent communication. Every member of the team should feel like they have been heard and can speak up. A good management team should also provide clear explanations of expectations. Employees need to not only know what they’re doing but why. Work may seem pointless without this explanation. Managers should work to build trust within their team as well. A trusting environment makes it easier to overcome negativity. Managers should make sure they understand their employees needs and follow through on promises. They should be open to suggestions and listen to concerns of employees. This includes being available for employees when they become frustrated and providing them an avenue to vent these frustrations. Lastly managers must be prepared to involve employees in the decision making process by gathering their opinions and acting on them appropriately. An effective team should always work to reduce negativity in their environment. My company works to reduce negativity by providing training to managers in the above strategies of management. We also strive to provide a positive environment for employees by introducing team building exercises and and promoting positive communication between team members. </p>

                <h2>How can you manage conflict in the workplace? How is your company doing this?</h2>
                <p>Conflict is often unavoidable when working as part of a team. Effective handling of conflict will ensure greater team productivity and quality. The needs of the individual employees and their concerns must be balanced with the needs of the organization. To ensure this my company works to establish clear criteria and processes for decision making within teams. Often times, conflict arises if a leader doesn’t work to involve team members in a discussion over a decision. By monitoring the team you can also gauge the willingness of all members to participate and cooperate. </p>
                <p>My company has implemented specific guidelines to be followed in case of conflict. These guidelines include steps such as determining how important the issue at had is to all involved and whether those in are willing to discuss the issue in a positive manner. The issue should be discussed in a private place with all parties can speak freely. Both sides must understand that they are responsible for the problem and need to find a solution. The participants must be guided towards a conclusion in a non-accusatory manner. Parties should propose solutions and then discuss these solutions with the team. These solutions should be evaluated in terms of cost and how well they solve the issue. The team should them reflect on the conflict resolution process and provide feedback that can be used during future sessions. </p>

                <h2>How do you communicate in conflict situations? How is your company doing this?</h2>
                <p>In order to effectively communicate during conflict both parties involved must understand that conflict is an opportunity to solve an issue. Both sides must understand that they are responsible for the problem and need to find a solution. During conflict it is important for all members to be able to state their views and beliefs in a non-hostile manner. Hostility and shouting will only serve to escalate conflict and lead to both parties hardening their position further. Blame for problems should be minimized or avoided entirely. It is more important to solve the problem than it is to assign blame for the problem. Blame makes people defensive which will steer the conversation off topic and away from conflict resolution. When proposing solutions it may be useful to look towards past solutions. What worked and what didn’t? Solutions that failed in the past should not be considered again without understanding why the solutions failed. My company strives to ensure that problem resolving sessions are as positive and effective as possible. We strive to involve impartial mediator in conflicts to gain outside perspectives on problems and keep the conversation on track. We also keep notes on problem solving sessions for later analysis so we can work towards better solutions in the future. </p>

                <h2>Why does quality suffer if there is a major conflict? How is your company doing this?</h2>
                <p>Quality suffers in a major conflict. Manor conflict takes the team focus away from improving the product and towards the fight. Infighting can create a hostile environment which can make it difficult for employees to focus on work. The lower morale may make employees less inclined to come to work or may force some employees to leave the organization entirely. Others may refuse to work with other employees or abandon their assigned tasks. Questionable decisions may arise during periods of conflict focused on preserving organizational inertia rather than innovation and change. All of this drains resources away from innovative products and solutions and puts them towards the conflict.</p>
                <p>As managers focus more energy on the conflict other priorities fall by the wayside. As a result of the decline in quality customer satisfaction will fall as revenue will follow as a result. This can due significant damage to the organization as they lose market share and reputations standing. </p>
                <p>My company strives to avoid major conflict by working to resolve smaller issues before they turn into bigger ones. We have systems in place to make sure employee voices are heard and opinions are respected. By resolving small conflicts we can make sure to avoid larger ones. </p>

                <h2>Social Networking:</h2>
                <p>Article 1 was on Airbus partnering with American design and manufacturing teams to produce the A220 which supports 275,000 American jobs. Zhuo called this a win for the US economy. I agreed and then highlighted that these sorts of partnerships are blurring the line of “American made” products. Colleen then commented on the fact that these sorts of partnerships are great examples of what was described in the text book.</p>
                <p>Article 2 was on GermFalcon. A device for cleaning the ISS with UV rays. I said this was a novel approach that could have potential applications on earth like many space technologies before it. Zhuo compared UV cleaning to other technologies such as autoclave and EtO and commented in the fact that we need to be careful with how these affect the human body. Colleen mentioned how this type of Roomba style cleaner would free up astronauts to do different tasks. </p>
                <p>Article 3 was on 3D printing aluminum and how the technology is so new that the Aluminum Association was unprepared to classify the new alloy. The Aluminum Association has finally established criteria for this process thanks to the development of a new material by HRL labs. Zhou mentioned how this will help with the commercialization of 3D printing. I mentioned how 3D printing could be a game changer for manufacturing on the level of CNC and then compared the advantage of additive manufacturing over subtractive. </p>
