                <h1>Questions</h1>
                
                <h2>Discuss the importance of quality partnering and strategic alliances. How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>Strategic alliances allow a company to reach a wider market. It is sometimes used as an alternative to growing the company or mergers and acquisitions. Companies enter into such alliances when each party has a certain resource or area of expertise that the other needs. The parties see these alliances as mutually beneficial.</p>

                <p>Quality partnering is a fundamental part of total quality partnering and strategic alliances. These alliances allow multiple parties to work together to deliver a quality product that is mutually beneficial to all involved. These parties can include suppliers, employees, customers, and even other potential competitors. When people work towards a common goal, resources can be pooled for greater effect. Additionally people can leverage the expertise of partners to deliver a quality product. </p>

                <p>My company uses strategic alliances to gain greater insight into consumer behavior as one partner may have more experience in a particular market. One partner may have access to certain equipment or be better equipped for dealing with local regulators. All of these actions will lead to a greater quality product that will be better accepted by the market. </p>

                <p>In order to form a strategic alliance, we must set an alliance strategy, select a partner, structure the alliance, manage the alliance, and then reevaluate the alliance for effectiveness. This last step is particularly important as a poorly conceived alliance will do more harm than good to quality. 

                <h2>Discuss the various forms of quality partnering and strategic alliances. Focus on the process model.</h2>

                <p>There are many different types of strategic alliances. </p>

                <p>Internal partnering occurs within an organization. Its goal is to create an environment which brings managers, employees, and teams together in mutually supportive alliances that allow for greater organizational synergy. By harnessing the potential of the workforce, companies can realize greater quality standards at a lower cost. One such example is multiple brands of an automaker co-developing a platform.</p>

                <p>Partnering with suppliers allows a company to foster a loyal and trusting relationship which will be mutually beneficial and lead to greater quality. One example may be a video game console maker partnering with a graphics card supplier to develop and deploy next generation computer chips. </p>

                <p>Partnering with customers is where businesses seek to involve customers early in the design process and gain feedback on a product or service before it is fully complete. This allows needed changes to be identified early. One such example is a software company providing a beta release of a new product to potential customers. </p>

                <p>Partnering with potential competitors allows both companies to combine resources in order to gain or maintain a competitive edge. Both companies can leverage the expertise of the other company to improve their own products. They can also help companies compete with a particularly well equipped rival. One example could be two major software companies jointly developing a new cloud based platform to compete with Google Cloud. </p>

                <p>Global partnering is where companies partner with a foreign entity to gain access to a new market. Companies that hope to compete world wide need to enter into these arrangements to gain a competitive edge in new markets for regulatory, cultural, and supply chain reasons. One example is an American company partnering with a Chinese company which is required for some foreign companies to operate in China. </p>

                <p>Education and business partnerships allow companies to leverage the expertise of another company in a particular business area to train their own staff. These services could include consulting, on-site training, and technical assistance. One example may be a company which outsources their IT infrastructure management to a third party.</p>

                <h2>Discuss the importance of quality culture</h2>

                <p>Quality culture is an important part of quality management. Quality culture fosters an environment which emphasizes that quality is everybody’s responsibility. Quality culture is evident in how employees behave at work, how seriously they take their work, if they take pride in their work, and if they strive for zero defects. If properly implemented a quality culture is an important part of total quality management and should be evident in the products produced by the company. </p>

                <p>Quality culture must be led by a competent senior management team who cares about quality and desires to inspire employees. Quality should not arise from a culture of fear but one of trust. Effective quality management cannot occur in a hostile environment where employees are fearful of mistakes. If employees fear mistakes they may try to hide them or shift blame rather than tackle the core of the issue. </p>

                <p>Implementing a proper quality culture takes time and cannot be rushed. Moving to total quality takes time. A rushed quality initiative will lead to confusion and result in worse quality. This can lead to wasted resources and money as well as lost opportunities.</p>

                <p>A good quality culture must be fostered slowly by caring and experienced managers.</p>

                <h2>Explain the difference between traditional and modern quality cultures</h2>

                <p>Organizations with traditional cultures differ from those with quality cultures in various ways. One example is in their operating philosophy.  In a traditional culture, the primary focus is on return on investment and short term profits. Often times this results in cost cutting measures that may boost short term profits but have a detrimental effect on long term quality and customer satisfaction. One famous example of this is Circuit City. Circuit City in an attempt to boost profits replaced its knowledgeable commission based sales staff with minimum wage non-commission based employees. The new staff wasn’t nearly as knowledgeable in helping customers with extrinsic a needs and although money was saved in the short term, in the long term the decline in customer satisfaction was so great that this decision is viewed as a major factor in Circuit City’s demise. A quality organization like what Circuit City used to be would have focused on building customer loyalty through a quality experience. A quality organization grows through short term goals which work within a long term quality framework. </p>

                <p>Another key difference between traditional and quality culture is management style. In a traditional culture management makes all decisions and employees carry them out. In a quality culture managers are seen as mentors who instill a drive for quality work in their employees. They provide constructive feedback and work towards goals together rather than setting production targets and leaving employees to figure it out. They reward and recognize performance. </p>
                <p>Quality cultures also differ in their attitudes towards customers. A traditional organization looks inward asking “what is best for the company?” A quality company looks outwards saying “what is best for our customers?” Customer satisfaction is the highest priority. </p>

                <p>The problem solving approach also sets apart traditional and quality organizations. In a traditional culture when mistakes are made a lot of effort is made to hide or shift blame for an issue rather than identifying a cause. In a quality organization people work to find the root of the problem. </p>

                <p>Traditional organizations also differ from quality organizations in their approach to suppliers. Traditional organizations have an adversarial relationship with suppliers where pressure is placed on them to ensure maximum speed and minimum price. In a quality organization suppliers are viewed as partners. They work together to solve problems with the supply chain and both improve through the exercise.</p>

                <p>The last area where traditional and quality organizations differ is their performance improvement approach. In traditional organizations performance improvement is erratic and reactive and is usually triggered by problems. Quality organizations focus on continual and incremental improvements. All factors which affect performance are considered always. </p>

                <h2>How do you understand who is a customer? How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>Companies produce products through various processes. Traditionally the participants in this process are referred to as customers and suppliers. In a traditional organization, suppliers are those who interact with the company prior to and during the production of a product and which provide some means to see the product through to completion are considered suppliers. Those who interact with the company after the product is complete and ready for consumption are considered customers. In this traditional sense both customers and suppliers are external to the company. They are not considered part of the process. </p>

                <p>In a total quality organization like my company, customers and suppliers can also exist within the company. They can be employees or other teams. Anyone whose work relies on the work before them is a customer for that person or team. Anyone whose work is consumed by another person or team is a supplier. In this way everybody in the organization is a customer and a supplier as everybody’s work relies on those who come before them in the process and affects those who come after them in the process. When a company considers those within the organization as customers there can be an increased focus on internal quality at every step. Everyone must understand how their work affects others. </p>

                <h2>Explain customer defined value, value analysis and retention.</h2>

                <p>Customer defined value is an important thing for any business to understand. The value of a service consists of a customers perception of product quality, the service provided by a business, the businesses employees, the businesses public image, the price of the product, and the long term costs of ownership. This combination of things creates an overall perception of the value of a businesses products. </p>

                <p>Value analysis is the act of determining what the customer defined value consists of. If a business doesn’t do this they run the risk of wasting resources on the wrong areas. The process of finding out what customers define value as. The process used to determine customer value consists of five steps. Determine what attributes are valued most by the customer, rate the relative importance of these attributes, access the organizations performance with regards to these attributes, ask customers to rate your product against another businesses product, and finally repeat the process again as part of a cycle of continuous improvement. </p>

                <p>Understanding these elements is key to customer retention. Retention refers to how likely a customer is to become a repeat customer and therefore a reliable revenue source. If a customer is satisfied with the product then they will likely come back for more. </p>

                <h2>Discuss product innovation models for customer retention</h2>

                <p>In a competitive marketplace companies must innovate to stay on top, and in many cases stay in the game at all. The only way to secure customer loyalty is to deliver better value. The only way to deliver better value is to innovate. By innovating on existing products and developing new ones entirely a company can expand existing market share, reduce costs, or even find new markets entirely. Business who fail to capture new trends in the market are doomed to fail no matter how big they are. The Praveen Gupta innovation model is one model that business can use to drive innovation. This five step process begins with, targeting the opportunity, or identifying customer needs and the shortcomings of existing solutions. The business must then conduct further research and explore the idea. Will this new idea be a success? The business can then develop alternatives. Perhaps the first plan wasn’t the best. All alternatives should be explored as well for viability. Once a solution is found it must be optimized for production and delivery, Finally the solution must be deployed to market with an effective marketing campaign behind it. It is important for the marketing team to explain why the new process is better. Otherwise the innovation will be a waste. </p>

                <h2>Discuss employee empowerment . How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>Employee empowerment in the simplest terms is the idea that employees should have some degree of input and control over their work. This can include input in selecting their tasks as well as a greater range on how to accomplish those tasks. When employees feel empowered to make their own decisions they take greater pride in their work and feel as sense of greater accomplishment. Empowered employees will be more motivated to drive innovation and save money for the company in various ways. Empowered employees will show greater loyalty to the company and are less likely to leave as they feel fulfillment in their work. In a quality environment where managers act as coaches employees can feel more empowered and that they can speak up and be heard. </p>

                <p>My company strives to make employees feel empowered in a number of ways. We encourage all employees to speak up with concerns and comments when developing new ideas. Taking employee experience and knowledge into consideration is an important part of total quality management. The cycles of continual improvement work best when everyone is involved as quality is everybody’s responsibility. Every employee has a unique view on their work and is a potential goldmine of ideas. Discussion of those ideas with everyone can lead to new processes and further innovation. </p>

                <h2>Discuss leadership for quality. How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>Companies which adopt a quality culture must consider leadership for quality. Leadership for quality is leadership which is conducted within a total quality framework. Leadership for quality is based on total quality management principles like continuous improvement. Leadership for quality gives employees the tools to succeeded and enhance their performance and output. Customer focus and an obsession with the quality of the service customers receive is an important part of leadership for quality. Companies must recognize the structure of work and apply rational and useful methods to accomplish it. They must allow employees some freedom over their work as every employee has a unique expertise. Quality leadership recognizes the value of teamwork and promotes a unity of purpose among teams. Continually improving people, teams, processes, and products will in turn lead to improved quality. In turn this will lead to increased customer retention. An investment in quality is an investment in the future. Quality initiatives handled by proper leadership will ultimately lead to greater organizational growth. One method to develop quality leadership is through workshops and training programs. By training effective leaders you are making sure they can pass those skills on to their subordinates. Good quality leaders understand best practices and pass those practices on to their teams. </p>

                <h2>How to lead for a better quality change? How is your company doing this?</h2>

                <p>Leading an organization through quality change requires careful planning and management. One way to observe the effects of a process change for quality is to run a series of simulations and tests in a virtual space. By using simulations organizations can test changes without risking the loss of resources or time in their production environment. One model of simulation used by my company is the following. First a company must develop a compelling change picture. This should be a vision of what exactly you want to improve and why. What will the company look like after this change? You must then present this picture to stakeholders and get feedback. Quality initiatives only work if everybody is on board. Next you need to develop a comprehensive list of potential roadblocks or challenges. By planning and anticipating these roadblocks in advance you could potentially avoid them altogether. Finally once the whole team is satisfied with the plan you go forward with putting it into action. After this you must analyze and adjust the solution according to feedback and lessons learned. This is an important part of he TQM cycle of continuous improvement. By analyzing past mistakes and effects of initiatives you can make the necessary adjustments to ensure the success of future plans. </p>

                <h2>Social Networking:</h2>
                <p>Article one was on using simulation software on CNC machines to save time and money rather than waste time and materials and valuable production space. The team discussed various reasons why software is becoming more important in pre-production testing. </p>
                <p>Article two was on aerospace manufactures choosing more general components from large companies over more specialized parts from smaller suppliers. Zhuo raised the point that specialized manufacturers must work harder to succeed in this type of market and must find a niche they excel at.</p>
                <p>Article three was on tech billionaire John McAfee's attempt to expose the creator of Bitcoin. I raised the question on whether or not revealing the true identity of the so-called Satoshi Nakamoto would help mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. Zhuo raised the point that the US Copyright Office has awarded Austrialian computer scientist Craig Wright a copyright registration for the original white paper describing Bitcoin but as the bar for copyright claims is lower than that of a patent some doubt his claim. Coleen raised the point that McAfee has frequently been seen talking about Bitcoin driving the price higher. She then discussed some other factors that could drive the cryptocurrency into the mainstream. </p>
