                <h2>Quality Cases:</h2>

                <h3>1989 Jeep Wrangler folding windshield: </h3>

                <figure>
                    <img src="img/windshield1.jpeg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 1: Detail of Jeep Wrangler sun visors which prevent folding of windshield unless removed. Image by Tim Barbara.</figcaption>

                <figure>
                    <img src="img/windshield2.jpeg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 2: Detail of Jeep Wrangler windshield hinge which has bent above the hinge joint causing damage. This hinge now needs to be replaced. Image by Tim Barbara.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The Jeep Wrangler is famous for its folding windshield but early models exhibit an alarmingly high rate of failure. As most owners rarely if ever fold the windshield down the hinge eventually becomes frozen in place. Part of the reason that most owners never fold the windshield is due to the design which requires the removal of eight different bolts including those which hold the sun visors. Plus, once the windshield is down the driver is left with the front roll bars sticking out which generates a lot of wind noise and requires a lot of extra effort to remove. </p>
                
                <p>As a result of this frozen hinge, should the owner then decide to fold the windshield down for either maintenance or to change their driving experience, the hinge will fold over on itself rather than move on its axis as intended. To the owner it may appear that the windshield is folding as intended as the damage they are causing is not obvious. It is only after the windshield is returned to its upright position that the damage has become clear but by then it is too late to prevent and the hinge needs to be replaced. </p>
                <p>This could have been detected during the design phase by Chrysler. The company had two seemingly conflicting requirements that the windshield fold down and the front roll bar extend forward to the windshield for improved safety. It seems that nobody did proper review of these two features and so a system was designed which ultimately missed one of the requirements. </p>
                <p>Chrysler could have designed the windshield with quick release fittings that wouldn’t require so many tools to remove. The sun visors, a carryover from the CJ-7 which the Wrangler replaced, should have been redesigned to swing away from the roll bar and not get stuck. This could encourage owners to fold their windshield more which would prevent the hinge from freezing up. Additionally they could have used thicker plates for the hinges to prevent them from folding if the hinge were to get stuck. </p>
                <p>In my company we are careful to analyze requirements carefully for conflicts and solicit feedback from our customers in cases where features aren’t being used. In the event an error like this makes it out we make sure to correct it in later models and offer options for owners of older models to upgrade the required parts. </>
                
                <h3>Broken Body Mounting Bolt:</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/bolt.jpeg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 3: Mounting bolt showing end of bolt snapped off. Image by Tim Barbara.</figcaption>

                <figure>
                    <img src="img/bolt2.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 4: Hole that had to be cut in vehicle body to remove bolt. Highlights poor serviceability. Image by Tim Barbara.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Years of corrosion have frozen this bolt in place. When removal was attempted the head sheared off of the bolt. This presented a costly delay as methods of broken bolt removal needed to be researched. Compounding this issue is the fact that the bolt was designed in such a way that the nut which holds the bolt is inside of the body rail and therefore inaccessible. In some cases this nut breaks loose from the sheetmetal holding it in place which causes it to spin uselessly when removal is attempted. The only way to proceed is to cut a hole in the body rail and extract the broken bolt. </>
                <p>This is a failure to consider the maintenance of this item during design. An important part of the product lifecycle is considering the maintenance and disposal of a product once it has reached the market. In this case it appears the manufacturer failed to consider what would happen if these bolts became corroded and needed to be removed. It is very important to consider the failure conditions that could arise in the product. When designing an item my company makes sure to consult all stakeholders, including those who perform maintenance on our products. </p>
                
                <h3>Damaged Solar Array: </h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/solar1.jpeg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 5: Overhead view of Stevens Athletic field showing relative locations of baseball field and solar array. Image from Google Maps.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/solar2.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 6: Detail of solar array showing damage from baseballs. Image by Tim Barbara.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Solar power is a sustainable green method of power generation but requires careful planning to properly implement. One important consideration is the location for the solar panels. This solar array at Stevens Institute of Technology was installed outside of one of the engineering buildings with the intention of providing power to the classrooms and research labs inside. Unfortunately the location chosen is just beyond the outfield fence of the college baseball field. This has resulted in a number of home run baseballs being hit into the solar array causing severe damage and reducing the effectiveness of the installation. Installing any sort of protective shielding to prevent baseballs from entering the array would also block the sun, thus further reducing the effectiveness of the array. One solution proposed by the university was to fine students who hit baseballs into the solar panels but this was met with a backlash as the baseball field predates the solar array and to fine students for hitting home runs would effectively punish athletic achievement. </p>
                <p>The placement of this array shows that the designers failed to consider environmental factors when designing their system. The decision to fine students to accidentally damage the panels shows a further lack of understanding and an attempt to shift blame for the problem away from the decision makers. </>
                <p>My company always makes sure to consider the environment in which our products are used. In case of errors in judgement we look for solutions to the problem rather than blame the user. </p>
                
                <h3>Garbage Truck Crash:</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/garbage_truck.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 7: Overhead view of garbage truck accident aftermath on NJ495. Image from CBS News New York.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>On July 3rd of 2019 a Union City garbage truck suffered a terrible accident that left 12 people injured and shut down both NJ495 and the Lincoln Tunnel just hours before the traffic rush to a long holiday weekend. The truck smashed through several cars and then went through a guardrail on an overpass overlooking the highway. The accident caused major delays and backed up traffic all throughout manhattan as drivers were forced to divert to the George Washington Bridge and the Holland Tunnel. </p>
                <p>Although an investigation is still underway as to the actual cause of the accident it is clear that there were several quality failures here. If there was an issue with the truck’s brakes it could highlight a failure to properly maintain the truck. Additionally, the driver stated in an interview that he swerved to avoid as many cars as he could and thought that the guardrail of the overpass would stop the truck if he hit it. This highlights a possible lack of training for drivers in emergency situations as he unable to safely bring the vehicle to a stop and mistakenly believed that the guardrail would stop the truck. It also highlights a design flaw of the overpass if it failed to prevent a vehicle from careening over the side. </p>
                <p>My company strives to provide emergency training to our operators to prevent accidents. Education is an important part of quality. Additionally we must work to ensure that all of our safety systems, such as guard rails and safety devices, are functioning properly in case of an emergency. </p>
                
                <h3>Leaking Faucet  </h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/sink.jpeg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 8: Closeup of leaking sink showing water covering the counter. Image by Tim Barbara.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The faucet in this bathroom has started to leak from the bottom of the handle. This has caused a constant flow of water to flood the sink countertop. This is leading to increased water usage and makes the bathroom more difficult to clean. There appears to have been some error in the installation and maintenance of this sink as the other faucet isn’t leaking. The fact that this faucet has been leaking for some time highlights the fact that maintenance of the sinks in this bathroom is not a high priority and has been ignored. This is a clear quality of service issue. Every day the cleaning staff cleans up the spilled water which effectively only masks the problem. This leak could be prevented with proper maintenance and regular inspection of the plumbing. The time spent on brief inspections and correction would be offset by the water saved by stopping these leaks. </p>
                <p>My company takes notice of wasted resources like water. Even if the problem seems insignificant it could be eating up valuable resources which in time will add up to a greater loss. In a total quality environment it is important that quality is considered on all levels of the process. No matter how insignificant it may seem. </p>
                
                <h3>Parking Lot Planter </h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/parking.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 9: View of planter obstructing several parking spaces. Image by Tim Barbara.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>When this parking lot was repaved, planters were installed at regular intervals throughout the lot. The placement of this planter has blocked part of four different parking spaces. These planters were added after the lot was completed indicating that it was a late requirements change. The placement of these planters significantly reduces the capacity of the parking lot particularly for larger vehicles. The purpose of a parking lot is obviously for parking. In an attempt to make the lot more aesthetically pleasing the designers and builders have lost this primary purpose. The process failure here is that the designers improperly prioritized a planter over additional parking spaces. This could have been a failure to interpret requirements or a failure in the requirements themselves. If the planters were added as a request from the stakeholders it seems that little attempt was made to integrate them into the lot without compromising parking. If they were added afterwards it may have been too late to properly integrate them into the design. A process for change requests may not have been followed. </p>
                <p>My company makes sure that all requirements are clear from the beginning of a project. However, sometimes needs change and requirements are added later. In these cases it is important that changes in requirements are properly tracked with change requests and documented in quality management systems. It is important these late requirements are properly integrated into the design. </p>
                
                <h3>737 Max</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/max.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 10: Undelivered 737 Max aircraft sitting in storage in Boeing's parking lot. The aircraft has been grounded for months leading to numerous cancellations during the busy summer travel season. Image from Wikipedia.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has been making headlines for the last few months over the global grounding of its newest 737 aircraft, the 737 Max. Two separate crashes, one in Indonesia (Lion Air 610) and one in Ethiopia, (Ethiopian Airlines 302) brought intense scrutiny on the plane which was grounded by regulators in Europe and China. The United States did not ground the aircraft until much later after pressure by the international community. Investigators focused on the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) which was a ew system which would automatically push the Bose of the aircraft down without pilot input or any  alert to the crew. Several pilots had complained about the system in the past and the lack of documentation on this feature. </p>
                <p>The MCAS system was necessary due to the larger engines uses on the Max which would cause the aircraft to pitch upwards. The MCAS was intended to give the aircraft similar handling to older 737 aircraft which would avoid the need to get a new type certification. This shortcut was to keep Boeing competitive with Airbus which had just introduced a new aircraft to compete with the 737. Boeing opted not to retrain pilots, a decision which proved fatal when flaws in the MCAS system reading data from faulty sensors caused two aircraft to pitch down into the ground. This situation would have been recoverable had pilots received the proper training. This highlights an education issue on the part of the pilots and a poor use of technology issue for Boeing. </p>
                <p>In my company we make sure to provide proper training and notify customers of all new features, no matter how small we believe they are. </p>
                
                <h3>Enter Here Sign</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/enter.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Fig 11: Entrance sign outside Conroe Texas restaurant. The sign takes the form of the international sign for Do Not Enter causing confusion at the drive-through. Image by Tim Barbara.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This is the drive-through entrance for a restaurant in Conroe Texas. Typically a restaurant with a drive-through will include a sign indicating where customers should begin queueing to place their order. These signs should be clearly marked to aid the flow of traffic and prevent accidents. This sign is confusingly designed to resemble the familiar international sign for no entry with the text “Enter Here.” This causes people to believe that the drive through is closed or inaccessible which could lead to confusion as people attempt to drive the other way around. It seems that the designers of this drive-through were unaware of the preexisting connotations of the sign shape that they chose. This could highlight a lack of education or awareness on international standards in road signs which therefore causes them to not be followed. This also shows a lack of cultural understanding as most people in the area would associate the red circular sign with a line through it as a Do Not Enter sign. The most obvious solution to this problem would be to change the shape or color of the sign so that customers can more easily find the entrance. </p>
                <p>In my company we make sure to adhere to all international standards and cultural expectations. It is important for any product to be designed in such a way that it makes sense when compared to existing standards and expectations. </>
                
                <h3>Building Stress Cracks</h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>These images were taken from around the Fredrick E. Giesecke Engineering Research Building. This building is a state of the art research facility which houses multiple laboratories and offices. The building was finished in May of 2015. Over the last few years multiple stress fractures have appeared in various locations around the building. According to the building manager, when the building was designed, settling of the ground was not accounted for in the engineering and structural plans. This has resulted in visible cracks in many locations throughout the inside and outside of the structure. Cracks in the outer wall has also resulted in hot air from the outdoors breaching the offices at the rear of the building reducing the effectiveness of the building’s HVAC system. As a result of this damage the university has had to redesign and rebuild parts of this building which is only four years old. The failure to follow proper engineering processes has resulted in an expensive set of problems for this brand new building. Additionally what should have been a world class state of the art facility has become something of an embarrassing joke among students and faculty. </p>
                <p>In my company we always make sure that proper engineering reviews are conducted by unbiased parties. We also make sure that our builders follow best practices and are comfortable raising issues with the design before they become an expensive problem. </p>
                
                <h3>Broken Door</h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>This is the entrance door to Fredrick E. Giesecke Engineering Research Building. The building features a double door main entrance which is accessed by a card swipe. Due to high winds which were unaccounted for in the original design the door has become damaged and no longer latches closed on one side. The gap in the door also allows insects and rain to enter the lobby of the building. There have been numerous attempts to repair this door but ultimately it keeps breaking when the high winds pick up again. The failure to include the winds in the engineering plan for the building shows that the designers did not consider environmental factors in their design which is a failure of process. The current “solution” to this problem is to hold the door closed with a cinder block and a sign prompting users to use the other door. This has led to some problems as the cinder block is frequently moved by students or by delivery workers who need to open both doors to bring packages inside the building. On some occasions the card swipe to this door also fails to unlock the working door. In these cases it becomes necessary to move the cinder block and use the broken door to enter the building. However, it is not possible to return the cinder block to its original position after closing the door so the wind causes further damage to the door. </p>
                <p>In my company we always make sure that our engineering plans include all relevant environmental factors. </p>
                
                <h3>Flooded Parking Lot</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/flood.png">
                    <figcaption>Fig 17: Image of a parking lot which has started flooding after a brief rainstorm. Image by Tim Barbara.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This parking lot has become flooded in moderate rain. The parking area lacks adequate drainage and was quickly inundated in a five minute downpour. This flooding has rendered the parking lot unsafe for both pedestrians and vehicles. This parking lot is only available to people with a valid parking permit. This permit is only valid in this lot which means that when this lot is flooded there is no reasonable alternative areas for the affected customers to park their vehicles. Due to overcrowding the nearest overflow parking lot is a 15 minute walk from the flooded lot. This causes many issues for customers as they now need to walk in heavy rain for an extended period of time. The design of this parking lot highlights a lack of understanding of consumer needs and a poor service quality as the alternative solution does not solve the issue. Additionally there seems to have been a process failure as the environmental factors in which this parking lot exists were not considered. </p>
                <p>In my company we strive to ensure that all of our customer needs are met. In the event they are not we make sure a viable alternative is in place. Our customer needs are the most important  factor in quality. </p>

                
                <h3>Portable Toilet</h3>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Fig 18: Image of a portable toilet which has fallen over in high winds and remained there for several days. Image by Tim Barbara.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Portable toilets such as this one are common fixtures on construction sites and at festivals. Such portable toilets are hugely important fixtures at these sites for both comfort of employees and regulatory reasons. This portable toilet at this shopping center has fallen over due to high winds. When this photo was taken it had been sitting like this for several days. This highlights poor service quality on the part of the installer. The toilet should have been properly secured at the base or placed in an area where it would be less susceptible to high winds. As it is now this toilet is useless to the workers at the site and may even be a health hazard if waste has escaped containment. The fact that this toilet has been sitting like this for several days shows that the installer is not properly serving customer needs. </p>
                <p>My company takes the needs of our employees very seriously. If there is a an issue with the facilities we provide to our employees and our customers we make sure to address it in a timely manner. Furthermore my company will provide alternative methods of service if the existing products are unable to perform as intended. </p>

                <h2>Social Networking:</h2>
                <p>Article 1 was on Midlands Aerospace becoming an affiliate member of Make UK which has broader engineering coverage and training expertise. This will also allow Midlands to have a greater voice in government. As government lobbying is one of the key aspects of global companies this move will allow Midlands a more prominent role on the world stage.</p>
                <p>Article 2 was on a new type of 3D printing called low force stereolithography. The process uses a flexible tank of plastic and a scalable light processing unit. Gilette now uses these new printers for razor handles. The new innovation pushes 3D printing away from mere prototyping and into serious manufacturing areas.</p>
                <p>Article 3 was on Mankiewicz’s system for painting aircraft. Mankiewicz invented the ALEXIT BaseCoat/ClearCoat more than 12 years ago and many of the aircraft painted with the original system are still flying with their original paint today. Mankiewicz’s system saves airlines time and money by reducing maintenance costs and cleaning costs. Zhou pointed out that this is a successful example of customer focus in a business. Colleen pointed out that this customer focus as well as the focus on eco-friendliness highlights the companies focus on total quality.</p>
